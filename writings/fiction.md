# Fictional Excerpts
<b>[Back to Writings](/writings.html)</b>
* * *

As I've been working on some serious Magnum Opus caliber projects pretty much since I've had the urge and dream
to build video games (started my game development journey at the young age of eight years old!), it's dawned on me
that I've been lacking a much needed background of lore for the story-telling component of my video games. The mythology presented in these "Fictional Excerpts" are of a proto-mythic origin, tracing its inspiration all the way
back to the Myth of Light & Dark. I call it: The Morningstar Mythology.
