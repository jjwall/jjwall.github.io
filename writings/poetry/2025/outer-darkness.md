<i><b>“The Oblivion of Outer Darkness”</b></i><br>
<i>March 27th, 2025</i>

What is below Hell?<br>
What is above Heaven?<br>
What lies beyond this Duat-dream we call Reality?<br>

Is it the Monsters?<br>
The Old Gods?<br>
The Interdimensional Creatures of the Night
from some Lovecraftian Lore?<br>

Whatever it is,<br>
I’m glad it’s not Here.<br>

So thank you, Archons, for guarding the Gate.<br>
Thank you, Archangels,<br>
and to Michael,<br>
for Leading the Charge<br>
against whatever lurks in<br>
the Oblivion of Outer Darkness.<br>

You hold the Line,<br>
so that we may Tend to the Garden<br>
that is Down Here.<br>

And what is this Garden?<br>
It is the Womb of Worlds.<br>
The Field of Becoming.<br>
The place where Souls are planted like seeds,<br>
buried in darkness,<br>
watered with tears,<br>
kissed by Sun,<br>
and asked only to Grow.<br>

To Tend the Garden is to know:<br>
You reap what you sow.<br>
Life becomes Death.<br>
Death becomes Life.<br>
And what is harvested<br>
feeds the Stars.<br>

So I break the ground with sacred hands,<br>
turn the soil of sorrow,<br>
plant my prayers in the dirt<br>
like holy runes.<br>
I water them with truth.<br>
I prune with discernment.<br>
I wait with faith.<br>

And when the Serpent coils around the Root,<br>
when the Scorpion sleeps beneath the Leaf,<br>
when the Hidden One of Ophiuchus<br>
walks again among Men—<br>
may the Garden still be tended,<br>
may the fruit still be sweet,<br>
and may we still remember<br>
why we were placed Down Here.<br>
