<i><b>“My Name is Ishmael”</b></i><br>
<i>April 2nd, 2025</i>

My name is Ishmael.

Which means “Man with God” in Hebrew.

I come from the line of Abraham and Hagar.
I was the first born of Abraham who made a covenant to God that his line through me would be the number of the Stars in the sky.

Isaac is my baby brother.

We love each other dearly and don’t understand the split between the Muslims and the Jews.

Jesus the Christ is of my same Lineage.

Through him can both Muslims and Jews united as one people.

Why the conflict?

Don’t you know you are worshipping and singing hymns to the same God?

One calls Him Allah

The other calls Him Jehovah

I call him Adonai.

Because that name has many holy pronunciations.

And one pronunciation has enough power to envelop the whole world.

So it’s best if we call him Lord.

Or the King of the Universe.

The King of Kings.

I know him as a man.

As prophesied by John the Baptist.

The wild man who survived off locusts & honey in the wilderness.

He said even he wasn’t worthy to “unstrap strap of His sandal on His foot.”

And yes, though Christ comes through my line.

Even I am unworthy.

Perhaps the Lord would grant me a metamorphosis.

To just be a pebble—wedged in-between the grooves of His Jesus Sandal.

Where my ego can settle in the groove.

And my Soul would find the healing it’s seeking.

Since I came to this chaotic war torn world.

My message is this:

“STOP DROPPING THE BOMBS.
STOP KILLING THE WOMEN.
STOP KILLING THE CHILDREN.
THE VERY MEN YOU KILL…
ARE YOUR VERY DEAR BROTHERS
IN OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.
WHO IS OF THE SAME LINE
OF THE LAST PROPHET MOHAMMED.
JESUS IS READY TO RECLAIM
HIS RIGHTFUL THRONE.
FROM THE IRON CROWN OF MAN.
THE WHITE-GOLD CROWN OF SPIRIT
WILL REIGHN AGAIN.
FOREVER & EVER.
UNTIL THE END OF TIME.”
