<i><b>“My Name is Ishmael”</b></i><br>
<i>April 2nd, 2025</i>

<b>My name is Ishmael.</b>

Which means <i>“Man with God”</i> in Hebrew.

I come from the line of Abraham and Hagar.<br>
I was the firstborn of Abraham,<br>
who made a covenant to God<br>
that his line through me<br>
would be as the number of the stars in the sky.<br>

Isaac is my baby brother.

We love each other dearly<br>
and don’t understand<br>
the split between the Muslims and the Jews.<br>

Jesus the Christ is of my same lineage.

Through Him,<br>
both Muslims and Jews<br>
can unite as one people.<br>

<b>Why the conflict?</b>

Don’t you know<br>
you are worshipping and singing hymns<br>
to the same God?<br>

One calls Him <i>Allah</i>.<br>
The other calls Him <i>Jehovah</i>.<br>

<b>I call Him Adonai</b>.

Because that Name<br>
has many Holy Pronunciations.<br>
And One Pronunciation<br>
has enough Power<br>
to envelop the whole world.<br>

So it’s best<br>
if we call Him:<br>

Lord.<br>
The King of the Universe.<br>
The King of Kings.<br>

---

I know Him as a man.<br>
As prophesied by John the Baptist—<br>
the wild man<br>
who survived off locusts and honey<br>
in the wilderness.<br>

He said even he<br>
wasn’t worthy<br>
to unstrap the strap of His sandal.<br>

And yes,<br>
though Christ comes through my line,<br>
<b>even I am unworthy</b>.<br>

Perhaps the Lord<br>
would grant me a metamorphosis—<br>
to just be a <b>pebble</b>,<br>
wedged between the grooves<br>
of His Jesus Sandal.<br>

Where my ego<br>
can settle in the groove,<br>
and my soul<br>
would find the healing it’s seeking.<br>

Since I came to this chaotic, war-torn world,<br>
<b>my message is this:</b>

---

>STOP DROPPING THE BOMBS.<br>
STOP KILLING THE WOMEN.<br>
STOP KILLING THE CHILDREN.<br><br>
THE VERY MEN YOU KILL…<br>
ARE YOUR VERY DEAR BROTHERS<br>
IN OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST.<br><br>
WHO IS OF THE SAME LINE<br>
OF THE LAST PROPHET MOHAMMED.<br><br>
JESUS IS READY TO RECLAIM<br>
HIS RIGHTFUL THRONE.<br><br>
FROM THE IRON CROWN OF MAN.<br>
THE WHITE-GOLD CROWN OF SPIRIT<br>
WILL REIGN AGAIN.<br>
FOREVER & EVER.<br>
UNTIL THE END OF TIME!<br>
