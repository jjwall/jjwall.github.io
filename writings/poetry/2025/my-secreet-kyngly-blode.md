<i><b>“Myn Secreet Kyngly Blode”</b></i><br>
<i>April the firste, in the Yere of Oure Lorde, 2025</i>

This nys nat but a rym.<br>
This nys nat but a worde y-brought by hevene’s whispringe.<br>
This is myn <i><b>Kynges Decre</b></i>.<br>
Y-spoken in the <i>tunge of poetes</i>,<br>
Y-written with light, with laughtre,<br>
And with <i>Godly Auctoritee</i>.<br>
Lat it washe thee over, as dew on holy hill.<br>

<i><b>I AM A SECREET KYNG OF LOVE!</b></i>

Myn Domes ben the Hid Rolling Hillës,<br>
The Pastures grene, the Forestës depe, and the Lakkës bright—<br>
Al y-hid from hem that be uninitiate.<br>

If ever thou hast nede of aught—<br>
Cry upon me, and we shul makë our covenaunt.<br>

I takë myn caffé thus—Americano,<br>
Oon shote of espresso,<br>
With a drope of milk and honi swete.<br>

Myn fruyt moost dere is the mangó.<br>
And I likë cheeseburgers alsó!<br>

Cometh now, and sitten thee beside the clepe<br>
Of this auncient, kyngly, and Harmonious-Divine Blode.<br>

I shal thee teche that which thou most nede to knowe.<br>
I shal thee linkë to whom thy soule most shal fynde.<br>
I shal helpen thee growe in al the craftës thou muste.<br>
That thou mayest Seën the Kyngdom of God,<br>
Alreedy y-bielded here…<br>
On Erthe as it is in Hevene!<br>

I shal thee inspire to hele at echë spere of being—<br>
Be it the rotes of thy eldres,<br>
Or thy unforméd boundës in the firmament—<br>
With the hevenes, goddes, aungels and feendës.<br>

For I am a counseilour among aungels.<br>

Not only he that wrestleth with God—<br>
But also,<br>
He that throweth that God to the erthe, and pynneth that Motherfucker to the mat!<br>

Haha! We japen in this halle.<br>
We holden it light.<br>
We maken merye.<br>
We Transcenden.<br>

But moost worthily:<br>
We Realizen the Deepest Dremës of oure Soule.<br>

So drynken we now—to myn Bretheren,<br>
And to the Sisterhede Aliaunce.<br>

We drynken to oure Destinées.<br>

👑🍻✨

<i><b>“My Secret Royal Blood”</b></i><br>
<i>April the first, in the Year of Our Lord, 2025</i>

This is not merely a poem.<br>
This is not merely a channeled work.<br>
This is my <i><b>Royal Decree</b></i>.<br>
Spoken in <i>poetic tongue</i>,<br>
Encoded with light, laughter,<br>
And <i>Divine Authority</i>.<br>

<i>Let it wash over you.</i>

<i><b>I AM A SECRET KING OF LOVE!</b></i>

My Domains are the <i>Hidden Rolling Hills</i>,<br>
Pastures, Forests, and Lakes—<br>
<i>Tucked away from the uninitiated</i>.

If you ever need anything—<br>
You call on me and we will make arrangements.

I take my coffee like this—<br>
Americano,<br>
One shot espresso,<br>
With a splash of milk, and honey.

My favorite fruit is mango.

And I like cheeseburgers too!

So come along and sit with the beckoning call<br>
Of this ancient, royal, and <i>Harmonious-Divine Blood</i>.

I will help to teach you what you need to know.<br>
I will connect you with who you need to connect with.<br>
I will help grow you in the capacities you need to grow in—<br>
So you can See God’s Kingdom Realm<br>
Already established here...

<i>On Earth as it is in Heaven!</i>

I will inspire you to heal at every sphere of existence—<br>
Be it the <i>roots of your ancestors</i>,<br>
Or your <i>unformed cosmic boundaries...</i><br>
With the heavens, gods, angels and demons.

As I am a <i>counselor among angels</i>.

Not only the one who <i>wrestles with God</i>.<br>
But also,<br>
<i><b>The one who pins that Motherfucker to the mat!</b></i>

Haha! We joke around here.<br>
We keep it light.<br>
We like to have fun.<br>
We <i>Transcend</i>.<br>
But most importantly,<br>
<i>We Realize our Deepest Soul-Dreams</i>.

So cheers—to my <i>Brethren</i>,<br>
And to my <i>Sisterhood Alliances</i>.

<i>We drink to our destinies.</i>

👑🍻✨
