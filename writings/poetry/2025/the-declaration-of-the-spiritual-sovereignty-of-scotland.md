<i><b>THE DECLARATION OF THE SPIRITUAL SOVEREIGNTY OF SCOTLAND</b></i><br>
<i>April 1st, 2025</i>

> By Royal Utterance of the Hidden King of Love,
In the Line of Wallace, in the Name of the Ancients,
And beneath the Gaze of God.

1. The Wound Must Be Spoken

Let it be known to all realms—Earthly and Divine—that Scotland was not lost by war alone,
but by a curse cast in the shadows of Empire,
when a tyrant named Edward—called “Hammer of the Scots”—
dared to violate the sanctity of the Scottish soul
by imposing laws not born of justice, but of conquest.
Prima Nocta—a crime not only of flesh, but of Spirit.
This act was not merely a sin against women.
It was a ritual severing of clan from land, of people from power.
And the echoes of that desecration still poison the ley lines of the world.

But I say unto you:
The wound has bled long enough.

2. The Throne is a Theft

King Edward’s Chair—crafted for coronation, seated upon the stolen Stone of Destiny—
was never an altar of unity, but a throne of inversion.
The crowning of English kings upon the sacred stone of Scotland
was a spell of dominion, meant to bend the line of kings to a false crown.

But the stone remembers.
The blood remembers.
And the Spirit of Scotland has not submitted.

3. The Rightful Flame Still Burns

I am a King not crowned by Parliament, but by Spirit.
I do not claim power by law, but by the fire that courses through my lineage—
the bloodline of Wallace, and beyond that, to the mythic roots of the land itself.
I speak not only for myself, but for the Sovereignty that lies in every son and daughter of Alba.

Scotland’s soul is not a province.
It is a Realm unto itself.

4. A New Covenant Must Be Forged

This is the beginning of the Reclamation.
Not merely of political independence—though that shall come.
But of the mythic identity of Scotland.
The return of her myths.
The rise of her Goddesses.
The rebirth of her Tongue.
The honoring of her land as sacred.
The severing of old contracts made under conquest.

From this day forth, let the Clans rise again—united not by war, but by purpose.
Let the Artists, Poets, Elders, and Keepers of Lore return to the Circle.
Let us call upon the Mountains, the Lochs, the Storms, and the Stone.

For Scotland is a Queen in Chains.
And we are her Dream returned.

5. We Do Declare

By my voice, and by the voices of all who remember:
Scotland is Sovereign.
Her myths are hers.
Her soul is hers.
Her destiny is hers.

And she shall kneel no longer.

Signed this day beneath a sky of ancestral fire,
By the Secret King of Love,
In the name of Wallace, of Brighid, of the Flame Eternal,
And of all Spirits bound and loosed, seen and unseen.
