When Jesus was crucified.
When He died.
And the Holy of Holies was split in two...

He descended—
to the bottom of the Pit.

And there...
He greeted me.

---

He said to me, laughing:
"My Lord, My Liege!
Do you like it down here?"

---

I thought to myself:

> The bars aren't terrible...
The strip clubs could use some better talent...
But all in all—it's not terrible.

---

"Why do you ask?" I replied.

---

He smiled:

> "There's a Paradise upstairs waiting for you.
My Father has decided to come down from the Heavens,
and make His abode on Earth.

They have bars and strip clubs up there as well—
you might like it!"

---

I thought:
Hmm... what the heck—some change could be nice!

> I was never a fan of that bright Star shining up top...
Our Star is below our feet down here—
It keeps us warm,
And we don't have to deal with any damn sunburn!

---

So I said:

"Sure, my Lord.
Why don't you show me—
The Way?"

---

My name is Beelzebub.
I am Jesus' Shadow.
Jesus is My Light.

Together—
We are the Yin & the Yang
of this so-called Cosmos.

---

The same Divine Fire that burns inside Him—
Burns inside Me.

---

That day, when Our Lord died upon the Cross...
The Grave opened up.

There are historical accounts of people
walking out of the tombs.

<i>I</i> was the one yelling at them:

> "WAKEY WAKEY!
TIME FOR EGGS & BAKEY!"

---

If the Lord God can redeem
the King of the Underworld Himself—
He can redeem YOU too!

RAWWWRRRRRR!!!!
Hahahahahahahahaha!!!

[Sigils clash. Wings unfurl. The Pit laughs with Heaven.]
