~Saint G.K. Chesterton

<i>This is the Heretic's Prayer:</i><br>

A Midrash for Mystics.<br>
A Gospel of the Shadow King.<br>
A Sermon from the Underworld‚Äîredemption in a shot glass!<br>

<b>When Jesus was crucified.</b><br>
<b>When He died.</b><br>
And the <b>Holy of Holies was split in two...</b><br>

He descended‚Äî<br>
to the <b>bottom of the Pit.</b><br>

And there...<br>
<b>He greeted me.</b><br>

---

He said to me, laughing:<br>
<b>"My Lord, My Liege!<br>
Do you like it down here?"</b><br>

---

I thought to myself:<br>

> The bars aren't terrible...<br>
The strip clubs could use some better talent...<br>
But all in all‚Äîit's not terrible.<br>

---

<b>"Why do you ask?"</b> I replied.<br>

---

He smiled:<br>

> <b>"There's a Paradise upstairs waiting for you.<br>
My Father has decided to come down from the Heavens,<br>
and make His abode on Earth.</b><br>

They have bars and strip clubs up there as well‚Äî<br>
you might like it!"<br>

---

I thought:<br>
Hmm... what the heck‚Äîsome change could be nice!<br>

> I was never a fan of that bright Star shining up top...<br>
Our Star is below our feet down here‚Äî<br>
It keeps us warm,<br>
And we don't have to deal with any damn sunburn!<br>

---

So I said:<br>

<b>"Sure, my Lord.<br>
Why don't you show me‚Äî<br>
The Way?"</b><br>

---

<b>My name is Beelzebub.</b><br>
<b>The Lion who prowls around seeking whom He may devour.</b>

<b>I am Jesus' Shadow.</b><br>
<b>Jesus is My Light.</b><br>

Together‚Äî<br>
We are the <b>Yin & the Yang</b><br>
of this so-called <b>Cosmos.</b><br>

---

The same <b>Divine Fire</b> that burns inside Him‚Äî<br>
<b>Burns inside Me.</b><br>

---

That day, when Our Lord died upon the Cross...<br>
<b>The Grave opened up.</b><br>

There are <b>historical accounts</b> of people<br>
walking out of the tombs.<br>

<i>I</i> was the one yelling at them:<br>

> <b>"WAKEY WAKEY!<br>
TIME FOR EGGS & BAKEY!"</b><br>

---

<b>If the Lord God can redeem<br>
the King of the Underworld Himself‚Äî<br>
He can redeem YOU too!</b><br>

---

<b>RAWWWRRRRRR!!!!</b><br>
<b>Hahahahahahahahaha!!!</b><br>

<b>[Sigils clash. Wings unfurl. The Pit laughs with Heaven.]</b>
