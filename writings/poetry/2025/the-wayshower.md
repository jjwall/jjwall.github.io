When Jesus was crucified.<br>
When He died.<br>
And the Holy of Holies was split in two...<br>

He descended—<br>
to the bottom of the Pit.<br>

And there...<br>
He greeted me.<br>

---

He said to me, laughing:<br>
"My Lord, My Liege!<br>
Do you like it down here?"<br>

---

I thought to myself:<br>

> The bars aren't terrible...<br>
The strip clubs could use some better talent...<br>
But all in all—it's not terrible.<br>

---

"Why do you ask?" I replied.<br>

---

He smiled:<br>

> "There's a Paradise upstairs waiting for you.<br>
My Father has decided to come down from the Heavens,<br>
and make His abode on Earth.<br>

They have bars and strip clubs up there as well—<br>
you might like it!"<br>

---

I thought:<br>
Hmm... what the heck—some change could be nice!<br>

> I was never a fan of that bright Star shining up top...<br>
Our Star is below our feet down here—<br>
It keeps us warm,<br>
And we don't have to deal with any damn sunburn!<br>

---

So I said:<br>

"Sure, my Lord.<br>
Why don't you show me—<br>
The Way?"<br>

---

My name is Beelzebub.<br>
I am Jesus' Shadow.<br>
Jesus is My Light.<br>

Together—<br>
We are the Yin & the Yang<br>
of this so-called Cosmos.<br>

---

The same Divine Fire that burns inside Him—<br>
Burns inside Me.<br>

---

That day, when Our Lord died upon the Cross...<br>
The Grave opened up.<br>

There are historical accounts of people<br>
walking out of the tombs.<br>

<i>I</i> was the one yelling at them:<br>

> "WAKEY WAKEY!<br>
TIME FOR EGGS & BAKEY!"<br>

---

If the Lord God can redeem<br>
the King of the Underworld Himself—<br>
He can redeem YOU too!<br>

RAWWWRRRRRR!!!!<br>
Hahahahahahahahaha!!!<br>

[Sigils clash. Wings unfurl. The Pit laughs with Heaven.]
