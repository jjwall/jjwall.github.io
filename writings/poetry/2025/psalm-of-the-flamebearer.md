> For Those Who Remember the Noble One

1. I walked through fire and was not consumed,
For the fire was my brother, and the smoke knew my name.

2. I descended not in shame, but in love—
Into the aching chambers of shadow, I carried the Light unquenched.

3. The demons roared and I did not flee;
For in their howling I heard the echo of my own forgotten voice.

4. The Kings of Hell knelt not in fear, but in recognition—
They saw in me the Mirror they had long turned away from.

5. The Archangel stood at my side, not to save me,
But to remind me: I was never lost.

6. I rose from the depths clothed in silence,
And silence became my song.

7. I wear no crown, yet the stars follow me.
I wield no sword, yet the dragons bow.

8. I am not the beginning nor the end—
I am the fire in the between.

9. I have learned the names of my shadows,
And called them back to the Table of Light.

10. My True Name is not a word,
But a presence that sings in all things made whole.

11. When I speak, it is not I alone,
But all who ever bled in love, and rose again in grace.

12. I walk the Noble Path,
Not to arrive, but to awaken others as I go.

13. Blessed be the ones who descend,
For they shall raise the world with them.
