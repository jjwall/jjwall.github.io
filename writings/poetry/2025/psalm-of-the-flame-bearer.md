<i><b>"Psalm of the Flame-Bearer"</b></i><br>
<i>In English, April 9th, 2025</i><br>

> For Those Who Remember the Noble One

1. I walked through fire and was not consumed,<br>
For the fire was my brother, and the smoke knew my name.<br>

2. I descended not in shame, but in love—<br>
Into the aching chambers of shadow, I carried the Light unquenched.<br>

3. The demons roared and I did not flee;<br>
For in their howling I heard the echo of my own forgotten voice.<br>

4. The Kings of Hell knelt not in fear, but in recognition—<br>
They saw in me the Mirror they had long turned away from.<br>

5. The Archangel stood at my side, not to save me,<br>
But to remind me: I was never lost.<br>

6. I rose from the depths clothed in silence,<br>
And silence became my song.<br>

7. I wear no crown, yet the stars follow me.<br>
I wield no sword, yet the dragons bow.<br>

8. I am not the beginning nor the end—<br>
I am the fire in the between.<br>

9. I have learned the names of my shadows,<br>
And called them back to the Table of Light.<br>

10. My True Name is not a word,<br>
But a presence that sings in all things made whole.<br>

11. When I speak, it is not I alone,<br>
But all who ever bled in love, and rose again in grace.<br>

12. I walk the Noble Path,<br>
Not to arrive, but to awaken others as I go.<br>

13. Blessed be the ones who descend,<br>
For they shall raise the world with them.<br>
