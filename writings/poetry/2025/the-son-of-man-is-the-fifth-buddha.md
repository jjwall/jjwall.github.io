<i><b>“The Son of Man is the Fifth Buddha”</b></i><br>
<i>April 2nd, 2025</i>
<i>A Transmission Received from Above</i>

<b>Jesus showed us The Fifth Way—</b><br>
The incarnation of The Name,<br>
Often pronounced Yahweh,<br>
But spelled: <b>YHWH</b>.<br>

He is the <b>Hidden Serpent</b>,<br>
The <b>Dragon King</b><br>
Of the Dragon Kings.<br>

Many expect <b>Maitreya</b>,<br>
But He’s come and gone.<br>
Though He’s still with us—<br>
<b>Two thousand years going strong</b>.<br>

The Jews call Him <b>Yeshua</b>,<br>
The Muslims: <b>Prophet</b>.<br>
The Christians: <b>Messiah</b>.<br>
Yet He’s much, much more—<br>
<b>Don’t stop it</b>.<br>

As <b>Buddha</b> met “I AM THAT I AM,”<br>
And <b>Moses</b> met “I AM GOD THE FATHER,”<br>
<b>New Egypt</b> knew “I AM GOD THE MOTHER.”<br>
And Jesus revealed—<br>
To the woman at the well,<br>
In that <b>great & glorious Chapter Four</b><br>
Of the <i><b>Gospel of John</b></i>:<br>

> <b>“I AM GOD THE SON.”</b><br>

He also said:<br>

> <b>“I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life.<br>
None shall come to The Father except through Me.”</b><br>

So there’s only <b>One Path</b> to the Father.<br>
Yet every path leads to the <b>Son</b>.<br>

Because the Son is much more<br>
Than meets the eye—<br>

Because the <b>Son is YHWH</b>,<br>
Translated as:<br>

> <b>“I AM EVERYTHING!”</b><br>
