<i><b>“The Son of Man is the Fifth Buddha”</b></i><br>
<i>April 2nd, 2025</i>
<i>A Transmission Received from Above</i>

Jesus showed us The Fifth Way—
The incarnation of The Name,
Often pronounced Yahweh,
But spelled: YHWH.

He is the Hidden Serpent,
The Dragon King
Of the Dragon Kings.

Many expect Maitreya,
But He’s come and gone.
Though He’s still with us—
Two thousand years going strong.

The Jews call Him Yeshua,
The Muslims: Prophet.
The Christians: Messiah.
Yet He’s much, much more—
Don’t stop it.

As Buddha met “I AM THAT I AM,”
And Moses met “I AM GOD THE FATHER,”
New Egypt knew “I AM GOD THE MOTHER.”
And Jesus revealed—
To the woman at the well,
In that great & glorious Chapter Four
Of the Gospel of John:

“I AM GOD THE SON.”

He also said:

“I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life.
None shall come to The Father except through Me.”

So there’s only One Path to the Father.
Yet every path leads to the Son.

Because the Son is much more
Than meets the eye—

Because the Son is YHWH,
Translated as:

“I AM EVERYTHING!”
