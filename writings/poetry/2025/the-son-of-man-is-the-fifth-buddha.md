<i><b>“The Son of Man is the Fifth Buddha”</b></i><br>
<i>April 2nd, 2025</i>
<i>A Transmission Received from Above</i>

<b>Jesus showed us The Fifth Way—</b><br>
The incarnation of The Name,<br>
Often pronounced Yahweh,<br>
But spelled: <b>YHWH</b>.<br>

He is the Hidden Serpent,<br>
The Dragon King<br>
Of the Dragon Kings.<br>

Many expect Maitreya,<br>
But He’s come and gone.<br>
Though He’s still with us—<br>
Two thousand years going strong.<br>

The Jews call Him Yeshua,<br>
The Muslims: Prophet.<br>
The Christians: Messiah.<br>
Yet He’s much, much more—<br>
Don’t stop it.<br>

As Buddha met “I AM THAT I AM,”<br>
And Moses met “I AM GOD THE FATHER,”<br>
New Egypt knew “I AM GOD THE MOTHER.”<br>
And Jesus revealed—<br>
To the woman at the well,<br>
In that great & glorious Chapter Four<br>
Of the Gospel of John:<br>

“I AM GOD THE SON.”<br>

He also said:<br>

“I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life.<br>
None shall come to The Father except through Me.”<br>

So there’s only One Path to the Father.<br>
Yet every path leads to the Son.<br>

Because the Son is much more<br>
Than meets the eye—<br>

Because the Son is YHWH,<br>
Translated as:<br>

“I AM EVERYTHING!”<br>
