> A Mythopoeia on the Origin Myth of Pipe World. I helped develop a video game fashioned in this universe with my game development collective. The game is titled, 
“Is It Okay to Lay Pipe in a Dungeon?”

<i><b>“Respect to Ye Old God, Father Time”</b></i><br>
<i>April 5th, 2025</i>

Hats off to you, Saturn.<br>
And to your white-gold spirit crown—<br>
A crown that’s circular.<br>
That represents a clock.<br>
Tic toc. Tick tock.<br>

Ye are certainly a sage of wit—<br>
A trickster of the most diabolical kind.<br>
Some call you Satan.<br>
Some call you Father Time.<br>

You surely got us.<br>
In this short life.<br>
But I’m a hero of the dungeon,<br>
Who came to lay the pipe.<br>

No more cunning.<br>
No more smoke.<br>
No more divine comedy—<br>
Which is time: the cosmic joke.<br>

As Parmenides of Elea taught us,<br>

A riddle of the Law of All:<br>
You see—the clock is round.<br>
All is One, and One is All.<br>
“We are not time-bound.”<br>
Is the wisdom of the western myth.<br>

And while you rule the solar system—<br>
You don’t rule the Aeon-writhe.<br>

Because time is not your domain.<br>
It is not your blade.<br>
Time is the joker card,<br>
Your trick of the trade.<br>

You surely got us—<br>
With that concept: the clock.<br>
But we know it tracks motion,<br>
Not the tick of the tock.<br>

So lower your defenses.<br>
And your illusory blade.<br>
This hero of the dungeon<br>
Pulled the winning spade.<br>

Hats off to you, Saturn.<br>
Hats off to you, Father Time.<br>
You once ruled the solar system—<br>
But no more time to shine.<br>

It’s time for the truth.<br>
It’s time for the pipe.<br>
For a new cosmic light<br>
To shine, shine, shine.<br>

Hats off, Father Time—<br>
Back to hell you go.<br>
This dungeon’s yours.<br>
And now we know.<br>
