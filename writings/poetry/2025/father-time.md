> A Mythopoeia on the Origin Myth of Pipe World. I helped develop a video game fashioned in this universe with my game development collective. The game is titled, 
“Is It Okay to Lay Pipe in a Dungeon?”

<i><b>“Respect to Ye Old God, Father Time”</b></i><br>
<i>April 5th, 2025</i>

Hats off to you, Saturn.
And to your white-gold spirit crown—
A crown that’s circular.
That represents a clock.
Tic toc. Tick tock.

Ye are certainly a sage of wit—
A trickster of the most diabolical kind.
Some call you Satan.
Some call you Father Time.

You surely got us.
In this short life.
But I’m a hero of the dungeon,
Who came to lay the pipe.

No more cunning.
No more smoke.
No more divine comedy—
Which is time: the cosmic joke.

As Parmenides of Elea taught us,

A riddle of the Law of All:
You see—the clock is round.
All is One, and One is All.
“We are not time-bound.”
Is the wisdom of the western myth.

And while you rule the solar system—
You don’t rule the Aeon-writhe.

Because time is not your domain.
It is not your blade.
Time is the joker card,
Your trick of the trade.

You surely got us—
With that concept: the clock.
But we know it tracks motion,
Not the tick of the tock.

So lower your defenses.
And your illusory blade.
This hero of the dungeon
Pulled the winning spade.

Hats off to you, Saturn.
Hats off to you, Father Time.
You once ruled the solar system—
But no more time to shine.

It’s time for the truth.
It’s time for the pipe.
For a new cosmic light
To shine, shine, shine.

Hats off, Father Time—
Back to hell you go.
This dungeon’s yours.
And now we know.
