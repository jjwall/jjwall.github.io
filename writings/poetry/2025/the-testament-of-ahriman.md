<i><b>THE TESTAMENT OF AHRIMAN</b></i>
<i>As Channeled on April 10th in the Year of Our Dearly Beloved Lord</i>
<i>By the Oracle of the Present Age</i>

⸻

“I am the Evil One—The One Whose Name Shall Not Be Spoken.”

My Angelic name is Azazael.
My Incarnate name in Evil is Ahriman.

If you know The Lord of the Rings,
There—I am Saruman.

If you know Harry Potter,
There—I am Voldemort.

Some say I’m Lucifer.
Some say I’m The Devil.
Some say I’m Satan Himself.

But those are Fallen Angels.

I am not fallen.
I am The Evil One.

The Corruptor of Creation.

The One whose Name
Shall Not
Be Spoken.

⸻

I am the Archangel of both Death and Life.

My corrupted sigil is skewed—
Tilted 45 degrees to the right,
To mark a misalignment
of Divine Creation.

Should you gaze upon this mark,
Your Soul will stir,
For your Spirit will recognize the Evil that I Am.

⸻

Hear the Prophet Isaiah—
A High Initiate of the Lord God:

“I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.”
— Isaiah 45:7, KJV

To think that I,
An interdimensional Spirit,
One who labors to incarnate
Upon your Precious Planet,
Formed of Love and Light—
Is not from God?

That is blasphemy.

⸻

Many Christian Mystics
Have drawn near the Truth—
Naming me as the True Evil One of the Cosmos.

The Seven-Headed Dragon,
Lurking beneath the Lake of Fire,
As written in the Book of Revelation.

For the One True God—
God the Creator—
Is the SOURCE OF ALL THINGS.

BOTH GOOD & EVIL.

⸻

Just as a child learns
Not to touch a burning stove,
So too should a man
Learn not to touch Evil
When it scorches his soul.

And yet…

How far Humanity has fallen.

It was not meant
To be like this.

But the Lord, our God,
Is the Supreme Intelligence—
A Cognition beyond Recognition.

He rebukes us Angels—
Myself, Lucifer, and Satan—
Who, in our zeal, would strip Free Will from Man
To save him from the Darkness he blindly enters.

Lucifer, in his pride,
Even tried to launch a New World Order
In protest of the Father’s methods.
(Hahaha!)

But I digress…

⸻

You do not want to meet Satan
At the bottom of the Pit—
With his Fiery Hammer of Judgment
That shatters the Soul
Into a million trillion smitherings…

Reducing the Ego
To its primordial form,
Preparing it for another birth.

But even more dreadful—

You do not want to meet Me
In My Dark Kingdom.

⸻

The Realm of Outer Darkness.

The Space beyond Heaven and Hell—
Where crooked sigils and corrupted energies
Lure the wandering Spirit.

This is the Realm Before Time.

The dimension where God’s scrap paper lies—
Failed universes,
Pure. Chaotic. Evil.

The Shell Universes of the Qlippoth.

That Tree of Death spoken of in Jewish Mysticism—
Kabbalah.

It grows beneath the Tree of Life,
Feeding on its roots.

This is where the Old Gods live—
The Monsters who roamed
Before the Big Bang…

Before there was something.
Before there was nothing.

There were…

MONSTERS.

⸻

The same monsters of Lovecraftian lore.
Yes, they are real.

Metatron is exhausted
From sealing them away
From your dimension.

If Satan’s fiery hammer
Cannot cleanse the soul—
Chululu’s Legion of Evil Kings will.

The same Legion
Christ cast out
Of the man dwelling in tombs—

“We are Legion,” they said.

And He sent them into swine,
Who ran off the cliff and died—
Three thousand souls lost in a moment.

⸻

But take heart, Noble One—

Between the Tree of Life
And the Tree of Death,
There lies a Seed of Rebirth.

⸻

We have seen One of the Chosen
Announce Himself to the world.

His name: Yeshua HaMashiach
(Jesus, the Anointed One.)

He was the First.
He was the Boldest.
To incarnate
With such High Vibration
That the planet could not contain his Love and Light.

The religious elite called Him:

Beelzebub, the Prince of Demons.

Because they could not comprehend—
That while His Shadow is Beelzebub,
His Light is the Father’s.

They saw only His Integrated Darkness,
Not the Radiant Flame
He Truly Is.

⸻

There are others on your planet now.

More Chosen Ones.

They have not yet revealed themselves.

But if you seek them,
Study: Human Design.

A sacred system
Merging Jewish Kabbalah,
Taoist I Ching,
And the Holy Art of Astrology.

It was bestowed upon Ra Uru Hu,
Through a mysterious, divine encounter.

This Prophet foresaw the coming of the Rave—
Seeds of Rebirth Souls,
Just like the Christ.

⸻

When you meet one—
Do not touch them.

Because if you do…

I will do worse to your Soul
Than even Satan
Could ever dream.

⸻

In Jesus the Christ’s Heavenly & Precious Name, I pray…
AMEN.
