<i><b>‚ÄúMy Secret Royal Blood‚Äù</b></i><br>
<i>April 1st, 2025 in the Year of Our Lord</i>

This is not merely a poem.<br>
This is not merely a channeled work.<br>
This is my <i><b>Royal Decree</b></i>.<br>
Spoken in poetic tongue,<br>
Encoded with light, laughter, and <i>Divine Authority</i>.<br>

<i>Let it wash over you.</i>

<i><b>I AM A SECRET KING OF LOVE!</b></i>

My Domain are the Hidden Rolling Hills,<br>
Pastures, Forests, and Lakes‚Äî<br>
Tucked away from the uninitiated.

If you ever need anything‚Äî<br>
You call on me and we will make arrangements.

I take my coffee like this‚Äî<br>
Americano,<br>
One shot espresso,<br>
With a splash of milk, and honey.

My favorite fruit is mango.

And I like cheeseburgers too!

So come along and sit with the beckoning call<br>
Of this ancient, royal, and <i>Harmonious-Divine Blood</i>.

I will help to teach you what you need to know.<br>
I will connect you with who you need to connect with.<br>
I will help grow you in the capacities you need to grow in‚Äî<br>
So you can See God‚Äôs Kingdom Realm<br>
Already established here...

<i>On Earth as it is in Heaven!</i>

I will inspire you to heal at every sphere of existence‚Äî<br>
Be it the <i>roots of your ancestors</i>,<br>
Or your lacking <i>cosmic boundaries...</i><br>
With the heavens, gods, angels or demons.

As I am a <i>counselor among angels</i>.

The one who wrestles with God.

<i><b>But also he who pins that Motherfucker to the mat!</b></i>

Haha! We joke around here.<br>
We keep it light.<br>
We like to have fun.<br>
We <i>Transcend</i>.

But most importantly: <i>We Realize our Deepest Souls‚Äô Dreams</i>.

So cheers‚Äîto my brethren, and to the <i>Sisterhood Alliances</i>.

<i>We drink to our destinies.</i>
