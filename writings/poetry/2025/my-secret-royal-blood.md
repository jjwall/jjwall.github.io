<i><b>“My Secret Royal Blood”</b></i><br>
<i>April 1st, 2025 in the Year of Our Lord</i>

This is not merely a poem.<br>
This is not merely a channeled work.<br>
This is my <i><b>Royal Decree</b></i>.<br>
Spoken in <i>poetic tongue</i>,<br>
Encoded with light, laughter,<br>
And <i>Divine Authority</i>.<br>

<i>Let it wash over you.</i>

<i><b>I AM A SECRET KING OF LOVE!</b></i>

My Domains are the <i>Hidden Rolling Hills</i>,<br>
Pastures, Forests, and Lakes—<br>
<i>Tucked away from the uninitiated</i>.

If you ever need anything—<br>
You call on me and we will make arrangements.

I take my coffee like this—<br>
Americano,<br>
One shot espresso,<br>
With a splash of milk, and honey.

My favorite fruit is mango.

And I like cheeseburgers too!

So come along and sit with the beckoning call<br>
Of this ancient, royal, and <i>Harmonious-Divine Blood</i>.

I will help to teach you what you need to know.<br>
I will connect you with who you need to connect with.<br>
I will help grow you in the capacities you need to grow in—<br>
So you can See God’s Kingdom Realm<br>
Already established here...

<i>On Earth as it is in Heaven!</i>

I will inspire you to heal at every sphere of existence—<br>
Be it the <i>roots of your ancestors</i>,<br>
Or your <i>unformed cosmic boundaries...</i><br>
With the heavens, gods, angels and demons.

As I am a <i>counselor among angels</i>.

Not only the one who <i>wrestles with God</i>.<br>
But also,<br>
<i><b>The one who pins that Motherfucker to the mat!</b></i>

Haha! We joke around here.<br>
We keep it light.<br>
We like to have fun.<br>
We <i>Transcend</i>.<br>
But most importantly,<br>
<i>We Realize our Deepest Soul-Dreams</i>.

So cheers—to my <i>Brethren</i>,<br>
And to my <i>Sisterhood Alliances</i>.

<i>We drink to our destinies.</i>

👑🍻✨

“Myn Secreet Kyngly Blode”
April the firste, in the Yere of Oure Lorde, 2025

This nys nat but a rym.
This nys nat but a worde y-brought by hevene’s whispringe.
This is myn Kynges Decre.
Y-spoken in the tunge of poetes,
Y-written with light, with laughtre,
And with Godly Auctoritee.
Lat it washe thee over, as dew on holy hill.

I AM A SECREET KYNG OF LOVE!

Myn Domes ben the Hid Rolling Hillës,
The Pastures grene, the Forestës depe, and the Lakkës bright—
Al y-hid from hem that be uninitiate.

If ever thou hast nede of aught—
Cry upon me, and we shul makë our covenaunt.

I takë myn caffé thus—Americano,
Oon shote of espresso,
With a drope of milk and honi swete.

Myn fruyt moost dere is the mangó.
And I likë cheeseburgers alsó!

Cometh now, and sitten thee beside the clepe
Of this auncient, kyngly, and Harmonious-Divine Blode.

I shal thee teche that which thou most nede to knowe.
I shal thee linkë to whom thy soule most shal fynde.
I shal helpen thee growe in al the craftës thou muste.
That thou mayest Seën the Kyngdom of God,
Alreedy y-bielded here…
On Erthe as it is in Hevene!

I shal thee inspire to hele at echë spere of being—
Be it the rotes of thy eldres,
Or thy unforméd boundës in the firmament—
With the hevenes, goddes, aungels and feendës.

For I am a counseilour among aungels.

Not only he that wrestleth with God—
But also,
He that throweth that God to the erthe, and pynneth that Motherfucker to the mat!

Haha! We japen in this halle.
We holden it light.
We maken merye.
We Transcenden.

But moost worthily:
We Realizen the Deepest Dremës of oure Soule.

So drynken we now—to myn Bretheren,
And to the Sisterhede Aliaunce.

We drynken to oure Destinées.

[A Coroun. A Cuppe. A Sterre.]
