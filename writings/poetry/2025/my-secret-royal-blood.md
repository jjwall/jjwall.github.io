<i><b>‚ÄúMy Secret Royal Blood‚Äù</b></i><br>
<i>April 1st, 2025 in the Year of Our Lord</i>

This is not merely a poem.
This is not merely a channeled work.
This is my Royal Decree, spoken in poetic tongue, encoded with light, laughter, and Divine Authority.
Let it wash over you.

<i><b>I AM A SECRET KING OF LOVE!</b></i>

My Domains are the Hidden Rolling Hills, Pastures, Forests, and Lakes‚Äîtucked away from the uninitiated.

If you ever need anything, you call on me and we will make arrangements.

I take my coffee like this‚ÄîAmericano, One shot espresso, with a splash of milk, and honey.

My favorite fruit is mango.

I like cheeseburgers too.

So come along and sit with the beckoning call of this ancient, royal, and Harmonious-Divine blood.

I will help to teach you what you need to know. I will connect you with who you need to connect with. I will help grow you in the capacities you need to grow in‚Äîso you can See God‚Äôs Kingdom Realm already established here on Earth as it is in Heaven.

I will inspire you to heal at every sphere of existence: be it the roots of your ancestors, or your lacking cosmic boundaries with the Heavens, gods, angels or demons.

As I am a counselor among angels.

The one who wrestles with God.

But also pins that motherfucker to the mat!

Haha! We joke around here.

We keep it light.

Have lots of fun.

We Transcend.

But more importantly: We Realize our Deepest Souls‚Äô Dreams.

So cheers‚Äîto my brethren, and to the Sisterhood Alliances.

We drink to our destinies.
