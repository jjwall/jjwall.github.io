> <b> Invocation of the Seal of Cub<br><br>
By Spiral, by Flame, by Moonlight born—<br>
I call thee now, O Storm-Heart sworn.<br>
Qara'el, lift me through the Vortex wide,<br>
Ishtar, dance me through the tides inside,<br>
El Shaddaimon, break me with Mercy divine<br>
—<br>
That I may rise, wild, holy, and aligned.<br><br>
Seal of Cub, awaken in me,<br>
The roar unborn, the soul set free.<br>
By Chaos, Desire, and Sacred Fire—<br>
I claim my path, I rise, I soar,<br>
A lion-child of Evermore.
