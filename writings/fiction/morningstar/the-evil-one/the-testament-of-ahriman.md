<i><b>THE TESTAMENT OF AHRIMAN</b></i><br>
<i>As Channeled on April 10th, 2025 in the Year of Our Dearly Beloved Lord</i><br>
<i>By the Oracle of the Present Age</i><br>

---

<b>‚ÄúI am the Evil One‚ÄîThe One Whose Name Shall Not Be Spoken.‚Äù</b><br>

My Angelic name is <b>Azazael</b>.<br>
My Incarnate name in Evil is <b>Ahriman</b>.<br>

If you know The Lord of the Rings,<br>
There‚ÄîI am <b>Saruman</b>.<br>

If you know Harry Potter,<br>
There‚ÄîI am <b>Voldemort</b>.<br>

Some say I‚Äôm <b>Lucifer</b>.<br>
Some say I‚Äôm <b>The Devil</b>.<br>
Some say I‚Äôm <b>Satan Himself</b>.<br>

But those are <b>Fallen Angels</b>.

I am not fallen.<br>
I am <b>The Evil One</b>.<br>

The <b>Corruptor of Creation</b>.<br>

The One whose Name<br>
Shall Not<br>
Be Spoken.<br>

---

<b>I am the Archangel of both Death and Life</b>.<br>

My corrupted sigil is <b>skewed</b>‚Äî<br>
Tilted <b>45 degrees to the right</b>,<br>
To mark a misalignment<br>
of Divine Creation.<br>

Should you gaze upon this mark,<br>
Your <b>Soul will stir</b>,<br>
For your Spirit will recognize the <b>Evil that I Am</b>.<br>

---

<b>Hear the Prophet Isaiah‚Äî</b><br>
A High Initiate of the Lord God:<br>

> ‚ÄúI form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.‚Äù<br>
‚Äî Isaiah 45:7, KJV<br>

To think that <i>I</i>,<br>
An interdimensional Spirit,<br>
One who labors to incarnate<br>
Upon your Precious Planet,<br>
Formed of Love and Light‚Äî<br>
Is <b>not from God</b>?<br>

That is <b>blasphemy</b>.<br>

---

Many Christian Mystics<br>
Have drawn near the Truth‚Äî<br>
Naming me as the <b>True Evil One</b> of the Cosmos.<br>

The <b>Seven-Headed Dragon</b>,<br>
Lurking beneath the Lake of Fire,<br>
As written in the Book of Revelation.<br>

For the One True God‚Äî<br>
<b>God the Creator</b>‚Äî<br>
Is the <b>SOURCE OF ALL THINGS</b>.<br>

<b>BOTH GOOD & EVIL</b>.<br>

---

Just as a child learns<br>
Not to touch a burning stove,<br>
So too should a man<br>
Learn not to touch Evil<br>
When it scorches his soul.<br>

And yet‚Ä¶<br>

How far Humanity has fallen.<br>

It was not meant<br>
To be like this.<br>

But the Lord, our God,<br>
Is the Supreme Intelligence‚Äî<br>
A Cognition beyond Recognition.<br>

He rebukes us Angels‚Äî<br>
<b>Myself</b>, <b>Lucifer</b>, and <b>Satan</b>‚Äî<br>
Who, in our zeal, would strip Free Will from Man<br>
To save him from the Darkness he blindly enters.<br>

Lucifer, in his pride,<br>
Even tried to launch a <b>New World Order</b><br>
In protest of the Father‚Äôs methods.<br>
(<i>Hahaha!</i>)<br>

But I digress‚Ä¶<br>

---

You do <b>not</b> want to meet <b>Satan</b><br>
At the bottom of the Pit‚Äî<br>
With his <b>Fiery Hammer of Judgment</b><br>
That shatters the Soul<br>
Into a <b>million trillion smitherings</b>‚Ä¶<br>

Reducing the Ego<br>
To its primordial form,<br>
Preparing it for another birth.<br>

But even <b>more</b> dreadful‚Äî<br>

You do <b>not</b> want to meet <b>Me</b><br>
In <b>My Dark Kingdom</b>.<br>

---

<b>The Realm of Outer Darkness</b>.<br>

The Space <b>beyond</b> Heaven and Hell‚Äî<br>
Where crooked sigils and corrupted energies<br>
Lure the wandering Spirit.<br>

This is the <b>Realm Before Time</b>.<br>

The dimension where God‚Äôs <b>scrap paper</b> lies‚Äî<br>
Failed universes,<br>
Pure. Chaotic. Evil.<br>

The <b>Shell Universes of the Qlippoth</b>.<br>

That Tree of Death spoken of in Jewish Mysticism‚Äî<br>
<b>Kabbalah</b>.<br>

It grows <b>beneath</b> the Tree of Life,<br>
Feeding on its roots.<br>

This is where the <b>Old Gods</b> live‚Äî<br>
The Monsters who roamed<br>
<b>Before the Big Bang</b>‚Ä¶<br>

Before there was <i>something</i>.<br>
Before there was <i>nothing</i>.<br>

There were‚Ä¶<br>

<b>MONSTERS</b>.<br>

---

The same monsters of Lovecraftian lore.<br>
Yes, they are <b>real</b>.<br>

Metatron is exhausted<br>
From sealing them away<br>
From your dimension.<br>

If Satan‚Äôs fiery hammer<br>
Cannot cleanse the soul‚Äî<br>
<b>Chululu‚Äôs Legion of Evil Kings</b> will.<br>

The same <b>Legion</b><br>
Christ cast out<br>
Of the man dwelling in tombs‚Äî<br>

> ‚ÄúWe are Legion,‚Äù they said.<br>

And He sent them into swine,<br>
Who ran off the cliff and died‚Äî<br>
<b>Three thousand</b> souls lost in a moment.<br>

---

But take heart, Noble One‚Äî<br>

<b>Between the Tree of Life<br>
And the Tree of Death,<br>
There lies a Seed of Rebirth</b>.<br>

---

We have seen One of the Chosen<br>
Announce Himself to the world.<br>

His name: <b>Yeshua HaMashiach</b><br>
(<i>Jesus, the Anointed One</i>).<br>

He was the First.<br>
He was the Boldest.<br>
To incarnate<br>
With such <b>High Vibration</b><br>
That the planet could not contain His <b>Love and Light</b>.<br>

The religious elite called Him:<br>

> <b>Beelzebub</b>, the Prince of Demons.<br>

Because they could not comprehend‚Äî<br>
That while His <b>Shadow <i>is</i> Beelzebub</b>,<br>
His <b>Light is the Father‚Äôs</b>.<br>

They saw only His Integrated Darkness,<br>
Not the Radiant Flame<br>
He Truly Is.<br>

---

There are <b>others</b> on your planet now.<br>

<b>More Chosen Ones</b>.<br>

They have not yet revealed themselves.<br>

But if you seek them,<br>
Study: <b>Human Design</b>.<br>

A sacred system<br>
Merging <i>Jewish Kabbalah</i>,<br>
<i>Taoist I Ching</i>,<br>
And the <i>Holy Art of Astrology</i>.<br>

It was bestowed upon <b>Ra Uru Hu</b>,<br>
Through a mysterious, divine encounter.<br>

This Prophet foresaw the coming of the <b>Rave</b>‚Äî<br>
<b>Seeds of Rebirth Souls</b>,<br>
Just like the Christ.<br>

---

When you meet one‚Äî<br>
<b>Do not touch them</b>.<br>

Because if you do‚Ä¶<br>

I will do worse to your Soul<br>
Than even <b>Satan</b><br>
Could ever dream.<br>

---

<b>In Jesus the Christ‚Äôs Heavenly & Precious Name, I pray‚Ä¶<br>
AMEN</b>.<br>
