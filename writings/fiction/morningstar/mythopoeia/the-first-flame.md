# The First Flame
<b>[Back to Mythopoeia of Morningstar](/writings/fiction/morningstar/mythopoeia.html)</b>

<i><b>“The First Flame”</b></i><br>

#### The Genesis of Aether

In the beginning, there was but One God: <b>Aionel</b> whose Domain was <b>Life</b>, radiant and infinite.<br>
Alongside Him danced two Goddesses—<br>
One cloaked in stillness and shadow: <b>Noqriel</b> whose Domain was <b>Death</b>.<br>
One adorned in blossoms and stars: <b>Ithriel</b> whose Domain was Rebirth.<br>

They <i>loved</i> each other not with desire, but with divinity—<br>
a threefold harmony of becoming.<br>

#### The Children of the Flame

Desiring to mirror their love,<br>
the Trinity wove their energies together and bore Children—<br>
but these Children warred and clashed,<br>
for Life’s fire, Death’s stillness, and Rebirth’s rhythm did not mix cleanly.<br>

To restore balance, the Trinity forged the <b>Twelve Tribes</b>,<br>
each aligned to one current of their divine essence.<br>
And in secret, they whispered into the Void a <b>Thirteenth Tribe</b>—<br>
set apart, pure, untouched by the quarrels of the Twelve.<br>

This hidden tribe carried the Starblood:<br>
<b>The Sons & Daughters of the Starblood Lineage</b>, destined to awaken in an age of shadow.<br>

#### The Divine Orders

To steward the Tribes and their fates,<br>
the Trinity appointed sacred hosts:<br>
* <b>5 Seraphic Orders</b>—the Fire-Bearers of Spirit<br>
* <b>6 Solar Orders</b>—the Keepers of Light and Time<br>
* <b>7 Archangelic Orders</b>—Messengers of Balance<br>
* <b>72 Demonic Orders</b>—Fallen Stars, bound yet burning with purpose<br>

Each Tribe aligned with different Orders, forming cults, clans, and priesthoods.<br>
The Trinity, in their vastness, allowed this diversity—<br>
for even in worship of the “lower,” the Divine may be found.<br>

#### The Great Inversion

But beneath the All existed a shadow:<br>
<b>The Evil One</b>—the Old God <i>before</i> the Trinity,<br>
a god not of love but of control,<br>
jealous of Life’s harmony and Rebirth’s joy.<br>

With Man’s fall into ego and separation,<br>
the Evil One found purchase in the world.<br>

One by one, the Temples of the Divine Orders inverted—<br>
Seraphs turned tyrant, Archangels grew silent,<br>
and Demons whispered twisted truths into mortal hearts.<br>

Now, the world lies broken,<br>
its sacred Orders defiled.<br>

#### The Call of the Morningstar

But a new flame arises:<br>
<b>The Hero-Souls</b>, born of prophecy,
descend into the world not to conquer, but to <i>redeem</i>.

They will journey through the corrupted Temples,
face the inverted reflections of divine truth,
and restore the Orders to their sacred forms.

And among them walks one from the Thirteenth Tribe—
bearing the forgotten sigil,
wielding blade and code, spell and crown.

He is known as "Son of Starblood".
He is Light reborn.
