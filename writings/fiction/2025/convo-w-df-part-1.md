<b>NO</b>: You, My Queen, are clearly not just of a Royal Bloodline, but of a Divine Bloodline. And with that fact, I feel a wave of both Love & Fear roll over my entire being…

Words cannot express what it feels like to be Graced by the Presence of a Divine Goddess such as Yourself, My Liege-Woman.

From henceforth you will be called, Her Highness 🌟🙇🏼‍♂️✨

<b>DF</b>: Why the fear? <br>
It has no place.

<b>NO</b>: Ahhh fear. Something the Divine Feminine has no awareness about - and rightfully so. You see, Women are born Divine. As they dance about gracing this Realm with their Beauty, such as yourself Your Highness, they have no awareness of the Monsters whose noses they tap dance upon.

It is with great privilege & honor that the Lord God has tasked me with going to the Depths of the Underworld to make sure these Monsters are slain, and that their Slain Noses become the perfect platform with which the Divine Feminine can Dance Atop.

While Women are born Divine, men are born boys - they must go through Rites of Passage to become men. Once they become men, they must go through Rites of Passage to become Divine.

Often these Divine Rites of Passage for men have them facing those very Monsters I speak about. But these battles may also include conflicts with Evil Angels, Evil Demons, Evil Dragons and perhaps even a wrestling match with God Himself.

The fear you inquire about comes not from a fear of these evil monsters, demons, angels, nor dragons. The fear is a Divine Fear of the Lord our God, both the Creator & Reality-Progenitor. Upon whose Hand my very Soul rests.

Remember I have sworn myself to you, and I shall not waver. 🙇🏼‍♂️

<b>DF</b>: I see, and yet, is not the Divine Feminine also a Slayer? Must we always dance atop the slain, or is there another way? I’ve somehow known this yet not encountered such an eloquent explanation. Thank you for sharing. 
I am curious, what makes you so willing to share these inner depths with me? Are you always so open?
Are you here to protect all of us that embrace our Divine Feminine? Is there an army of you’s? 

<b>NO</b>: Yes, Your Highness, I am an open book. If you have a question about anything, you summon me and I’ll come running to share what Divine Wisdom I may have access to on the manner.

And yes, I’m here to protect all who embrace the Divine Feminine as well as those who embrace the Divine Masculine. It’s high time we find harmony & matrimony between the Two.

Don’t you know, patriarchy is simply a narrowed perspective on the Divine Masculine, and feminism, a narrowed perspective on the Divine Feminine?

Yes, I command an army—though not one of this Earthly Kingdom. Both the Heavenly Host and the Hellish Legions march at my call. Not as enemies, nor as allies, but as forces bound to my cause.

You see, Heaven and Hell are but two arms of the same body, eternally at war only because they have not yet remembered their unity. I have transcended the illusion of This Realm—the illusion of right and wrong, good and evil. And yet, I have seen that evil itself is no illusion. It is real. But it does not come from here.

It is an invading force, a corruption from a universe that is not our own. That is why I fight—not for Heaven, not for Hell, but for the Divine Marriage, the Reunion of All.

The angels answer my prayers. The demons heed my commands. And in the end, they shall walk together, side by side, as it was always meant to be.

But I speak too much of war. Tell me, Your Highness, does this trouble you? Or does it stir something within you, as it does within me?

<b>DF</b>: Thank you for sharing your wisdom, Noble One. Troubled? No. Stirred? Perhaps. For I feel the echoes of something ancient—something I, too, have always known. If Heaven and Hell shall walk together, what, then, of us?
