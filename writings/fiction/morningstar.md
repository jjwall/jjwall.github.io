# Morningstar Mythology
<b>[Back to Fiction](/writings/fiction.html)</b>
* * *

As I've been working on some serious Magnum Opus caliber projects pretty much since I've had the urge and dream to build video games (started my game development journey at the young age of eight years old!), it's dawned on me that I've been lacking a much needed background of lore for the story-telling component of my video games. 

The mythology presented in the contents of this page are of a proto-mythic origin, tracing its inspiration all the way back to the Myth of Light & Dark, the Myth of Life & Death, and the Mythology behind J.R.R. Tolkien's, The Lord of the Rings.

I call it: <i><b>The Morningstar Mythology</b></i>.
