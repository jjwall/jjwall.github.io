The mythology presented in these "Fictional Excerpts" are of a proto-mythic origin, tracing its inspiration all the way back to the Myth of Light & Dark and the Myth of Life & Death. Here you will see the heroic encounters with Primordial Monsters of our Mystic-Warrior-Poet, the Noble One. As well as some conversations he has with various Divine Beings.
