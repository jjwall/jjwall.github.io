# Poetry
<b>[Back to Writings](/writings.html)</b>
* * *

Poetry has been the key to unlocking my creative flow and harnessing the Heavenly Energies which Our Lord God 
so Graciously pours down onto me. I feel I can't take proper credit for the poems I write as they come to me in 
a web of complex emotional layers. My job is to channel whatever that form is, write down what makes sense,
and sometimes use ChatGPT to capture additional verse that I may be unable to convey myself. Typically, inspiriation for my poetry comes as I am guided through intense emotions and, most importantly, feel ALL THE WAY through to the end of whatever complex layers of emotional experience that may include.

People often ask, "how is that you don't medicate?" My medication has been an addiction to both Fear & Love as articulated through my poem of the same name. Emotions are my drug of choice, and I suppose that is what has turned me into a bit of a poet.
