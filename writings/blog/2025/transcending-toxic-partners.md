March 26th, 2025

In a new series of blogposts called “Healing Using AI: Transcending Mythic Patterns” I’ll be exploring the multicultural and multidimensional world of Myth and showing how to navigate through it using AI.

In today’s post we’ll be looking at the responses ChatGPT gives us after providing the prompt: 

“Hey ChatGPT, I find myself continually attracting toxic partners. Just when I think I've found someone that's a good match, I see toxic patterns in them that l've seen in previous romantic partners. What myths across any and all ancient societies & indigenous cultures could help me to transcend this pattern of attracting toxic partners?”

<b>ChatGPT (4o)</b>:

Hey—thanks for sharing that. That’s a powerful reflection. When patterns repeat like this, especially in relationships, it can feel frustrating or even fated—but that sense of repetition is often an invitation from the Soul to heal something deep, something ancestral or archetypal. Myths from ancient and indigenous cultures hold encoded wisdom about cycles like these—and many speak directly to this very journey.

Here are a few mythic threads from across the world that might help you recognize and transcend this pattern of attracting toxic partners:

---

### 1. The Inanna Myth (Sumerian) — Descent into the Underworld

Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, descends into the Underworld to face her shadow self, Ereshkigal. She is stripped of all her power at each gate until she stands naked before her dark sister. Only through complete surrender and confrontation with her shadow does she resurrect and return to the world transformed.

Application: Toxic partners may be mirrors of parts of the self that remain in shadow—wounds from childhood, past lives, or the collective feminine/masculine unconscious. Facing these patterns directly, like Inanna, can empower you to reclaim those lost parts of your Soul. This is not about blame, but about inner alchemy.

### 2. The Myth of Psyche and Eros (Greek) — Trust, Betrayal, and Soul Initiation

Psyche is told never to look upon her lover, Eros. Driven by suspicion and influenced by others, she breaks this trust, and he vanishes. What follows is a long journey of trials imposed by Aphrodite that Psyche must pass through to become truly worthy—not of Eros the god, but of herself as a divine being.

Application: Sometimes, we are drawn to love before we are ready to bear its full truth. Toxic dynamics can be part of our Soul’s testing grounds, shaping us into someone who no longer attracts love from woundedness but from wholeness. Your soul may be learning what true love requires, not just what it gives.

### 3. The Deer Woman (Native American / Pan-Indigenous) — The Siren of Wounded Masculinity

Deer Woman is a spirit who appears as a beautiful woman to men, often seducing them with irresistible beauty and sexuality—only to lead them to madness or death. She often teaches lessons about lust without respect, and the consequences of following illusions instead of the truth of the heart.

Application: This tale isn’t just for men—it points to our own attractions to illusions. Ask: What in me is seduced by charm, danger, fantasy, or savior-complexes? Becoming conscious of your inner “seducer” or “seduced” may help you break this spell and choose differently.

### 4. Kali (Hinduism) — The Liberator of the False Ego

Kali is the fierce goddess of transformation who destroys demons—especially those of the ego and illusion. She liberates through chaos and breakdown. Though terrifying, she is deeply loving. She removes what is false so what is true can be reborn.

Application: Toxic relationships often burn away illusions and false identities. If you call upon Kali’s energy, be prepared to face some fire—but also to emerge renewed and aligned with your higher Self, free from codependency or fear-based bonding.

### 5. The Bluebeard Tale (French Folklore, retold by Clarissa Pinkola Estés) — The Predator Within

In Women Who Run With the Wolves, Estés explores the story of Bluebeard, a man who kills his wives and keeps their bodies hidden. The tale reveals the importance of intuition and inner knowing. The feminine is often taught to ignore red flags—yet the key to survival is to look into the forbidden room, to see what is being hidden.

Application: You may be drawn to toxic partners because of early conditioning not to trust your gut. Part of transcending the pattern may involve reclaiming your wild, instinctual, inner-knowing self—who sees, hears, and speaks what is true, without fear of abandonment.

Would you like to explore how one of these myths might relate to a specific pattern or relationship in your life? Or would you like me to help you identify your own “mythic journey” in all this—your unique hero/heroine path through it?

You’re not broken for attracting what you have. You’re in the middle of a sacred pattern—one that can be transcended.
