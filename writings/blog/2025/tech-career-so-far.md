### <i>Overview</i>

I am a High Tech Operator and Deep Tech Researcher with nearly nine years of professional experience in AI DevSecOps, MLOps engineering leadership, software architecture, security engineering, video game design, and full-stack application development.

For four of those years, I served at Deloitte, delivering innovation to both government and commercial clients‚Äîincluding the Navy, Army, Space Force, AFSOC, Dell, Intel, Qualcomm, and the Cyber AI Innovations portfolio. I‚Äôve held a Public Trust Clearance with the Department of Homeland Security and carried an Army contractor Common Access Card.

### <i>Department of Defense Contracting</i>

At Deloitte, I led development on next-generation field technology for various branches of the U.S. Military through the TATRC Research and Development program and for the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. This included categorizing weapon systems data on classified networks and architecting <b>portable battlefield networks</b>‚Äîthink Pac Star meets AWS Automan‚Äîempowering combat medics to carry secure, high-speed communications in their packs.

These kits came preloaded with an NSA-approved, end-to-end encrypted VOIP communication platform‚Äînot unlike a battlefield-ready Discord‚Äîallowing medics via bots programmed with one-finger-tap functionalities to instantly connect with remote care specialists for rapid triage of complex wounds.

I was also the lead developer behind <b>Sidecar</b>, a React Native mobile app designed to complement this medic bot ecosystem. Built using Expo tooling, Sidecar fulfilled the DoD‚Äôs ‚ÄúStore-It-Forward‚Äù initiative‚Äîensuring all network communications are securely stored on local devices, enabling mission continuity even in blackout conditions.

These projects remain dear to my heart. They reflect what I believe is essential: the modernization of battlefield comms and triage protocols to save lives and serve peacekeeping missions around the globe.

### <i>On-Device AI Engineering</i>

Being recruited from federal to commerical contracting by the Hybrid AI group, I served as the technical lead for <b>Neuron</b>, a Copilot-like coding assistant that runs entirely on-device‚Äîoffering code suggestions while preserving full privacy over sensitive codebases.

I also architected <b>Celium</b>, a chip intelligence testing platform for on-device AI. It enabled rapid comparison of model runtimes, SDKs, and AI frameworks across varying chip architectures‚ÄîCPU, GPU, and NPU‚Äîespecially for Intel and Qualcomm teams optimizing performance at the silicon level.

### <i>AI Innovation in Cyber Security</i>

Based on Neuron's firm-wide success, I was recruited from Deloitte‚Äôs Hybrid AI practice into <b>Cyber AI</b> as technical hire #1, tasked with founding the engineering culture and team. Once the group matured, I stepped into the role of <b>AI DevSecOps & MLOps Engineering Lead</b>, reporting directly to the COO of Cyber AI.

There, I led a cross-functional team of elite engineers spanning DevSecOps, MLOps, LLMOps, full stack, QA, test automation, compliance, and delivery.

> <b>Our mission: Secure intelligence by design‚Äîembedding trust, scalability, and velocity into every layer of the AI development lifecycle.</b>

From idea to impact, I helped usher AI innovations through every phase of delivery:
* Ideation ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Technical Design
* Team Assembly ‚Üí Development & Prototyping
* QA ‚Üí Beta Testing ‚Üí Client Pilots
* Compliance ‚Üí Production Deployment ‚Üí Operational Handoff

I specialized in navigating the crossroads of security, innovation, and scale‚Äîengineering systems to thrive in both battlefield and boardroom.

### <i>Notable Cyber AI Assets</i>

Two flagship AI assets I led and helped bring to life:
* <b>TPRM Accelerator</b> ‚Äì An on-device AI assistant that reduces the time analysts spend reviewing third-party risk management documentation and questionnaires. It unlocked a <b>$110M</b> pipeline.
* <b>Digital Analyst</b> ‚Äì An AI-powered SaaS for SOC analysts, accelerating the triage of security alerts by analyzing both current data and historical context. This solution unlocked a <b>$60M</b> pipeline.

### <i> Technology Mastery</i>

My toolkit includes:
* <b>Languages & Frameworks</b>: GDScript, ActionScript, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, C#, Python, Golang, Rust, HTML, CSS
* <b>Front-end, Desktop, & Mobile</b>: React, React Native (Expo), Electron, PyQt, Qt
* <b>Back-end & Infrastructure</b>: Node, Deno, .NET Core, NPM, Webpack, Vite, PyInstaller, Make
* <b>Game Engines & Vision</b>: Three.js, Godot, Unity
* <b>AI & Model Runtimes</b>: Ollama, Huggingface, OpenVINO, QNN, CUDA
* <b>DevOps Tools</b>: Git/GitHub, CI/CD pipelines, CLI, Bash, PowerShell, cloud-native deployment platforms

### <i>My Passion for Video Game Development</i>

Beyond the professional battlefield, I have lived a parallel life as a video game developer <b>since age eight</b>‚Äîcreating worlds, characters, and stories for the joy of it.

Today, I build games using <b>Godot</b>, <b>Unity</b>, and a custom-built networked engine powered by Node, TypeScript, and Three.js known as [Boardhouse](https://jjwall.github.io/BoardhouseTS/).

My favorite open source contribution is [AetherCore](https://github.com/peligrolabs/AetherCore), a 2D/3D MMO-lite game framework featuring a Godot client and a .NET Core backend.

To explore my game worlds, visit the [Projects Page on my site](https://jjwall.github.io/projects.html).

### <i>In Closing</i>

From the cold certainties of national defense to the magical realms of interactive storytelling, I‚Äôve carved out a path that honors both structure and spirit.

<b>Every system I build‚Äîbe it for warfighter, analyst, or player‚Äîis a prayer for a more resilient, inspired, and integrated future.</b>

The next chapter of my career is devoted to creating sacred technologies that serve the soul, the story, and the sovereign self.

Let‚Äôs build something timeless.
