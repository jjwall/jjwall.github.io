<b>[Back to Blogposts](/writings/blog.html)</b>

#### <i>Soul as The Personal Mythic Codex: Preface</i>

Today, I'm sharing a glimpse into the book I'm currently writing‚Äîa nine-part exploration of a concept I call <i>Soul as The Personal Mythic Codex</i>.

#### <i>Soul as The Personal Mythic Codex: An Introduction</i>
What is <i>Soul</i>? I could show you a thousand fingers pointing to the same Moon, and yet each of us would see something different‚Äîeach perspective shaped by our unique eyes and life experiences. So it has dawned on me to share what I feel the Moon‚Äîor in this case, the Soul‚Äîtruly is.

We choose the bodies we are born into, and the parents we are born to. Our parents may choose to conceive a child, but they do not choose which <i>Soul</i> incarnates. It is <i>we</i> who choose the specific baby-avatar-body and family lineage as a vessel for our Soul's descent into this realm. 

So then, what the heck is a Soul? My understanding is this: 
> A Soul is a Personal Mythic Codex composed of Nine Layers of Unique Identification. Yes, your Soul includes aspects of your astral and cultural identities‚Äîbut these only scratch the surface of what your Soul truly is in its full, integrated form.

Let‚Äôs break it down. From the lowest to the highest level of identification, the Soul‚Äîyour Personal Mythic Codex‚Äîis composed of:
- <b>Ancestral</b>
- <b>Cultural</b>
- <b>Religious</b>
- <b>Royal</b>
- <b>Sanctified</b>
- <b>Angelic & Demonic</b>
- <b>Astral / Spiritual</b>
- <b>Mythic</b>
- <b>Cosmic / Proto-Mythic</b>

...identifications.

Through this nine-part blogpost series, we will explore each layer of the Soul‚Äôs Nine-Fold Personal Identification Codex starting with the <i>Soul's Ancestral Identification</i>, and move up to the next layer of identification with each subsequent blogpost in the series.

#### <i>Soul as The Personal Mythic Codex: The Soul's Ancestral Identification</i>

The <i>Soul's Ancestral Identification</i> forms your <b>root system</b>.  It is intimately tied to your <i>present-day physical body</i>‚Äîits lineage, form, and inherited memory. Not only can this be tied to lineages from both your Mother‚Äôs and Father‚Äôs bloodlines, but this can also be tied to your immediate (AKA nuclear) and extended families. Trauma often moves through ancestral lineages. What is not healed by one generation <b>must</b> be faced by the next.

For more information on how trauma is inherited through ancestral lineages, please see Mark Wolynn‚Äôs book, [It Didn‚Äôt Begin With You: How Inherited Family Trauma Shapes Who We Are and How to End the Cycle](https://www.amazon.com/Didnt-Start-You-Inherited-Family/dp/1101980389). 

Additionally, some additional high-level information on healing past-lives related to the ancestral line, please see [Dolores Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_Cannon)'s [collection of books bubbling with profound wisdom](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=dolores+cannon&crid=3LJ6SPIVFT4WO&sprefix=dolores+cannon%2Caps%2C163) and specifically her <i>Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique</i>, a high-level hypnotherapy used to help heal past-life and ancestrally-related trauma.<sup>[[1]](https://www.hypnotherapy-directory.org.uk/articles/qhht-the-gold-standard-of-past-life-regression)</sup><sup>[[2]](https://journeystoheal.com/services/qhht-los-angeles/)</sup>

Furthermore, we can really <i>feel into the trauma</i> that may have been carried over from previous generations into our own bodies today.

<i>Yoga</i> is a powerful practice for attuning to the subtle signals of your body‚Äîmoment by moment, day by day.

When you experience particular pains or sensations that persist in your body (for me, an <i><b>extremely</b></i> tight left hip has been a lifelong struggle), it's worth exploring their origin‚Äînot just physically, but spiritually and ancestrally as well.

One powerful resource is Jacques Martel's [The Encyclopedia of Ailments and Diseases: How to Heal the Conflicted Feelings, Emotions, and Thoughts at the Root of Illness](https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Ailments-Diseases-Conflicted-Feelings/dp/1644111896?crid=27GL1B6B0EP18&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.lmqlUqe7uyZviFA34X67uF14kNGimJTDS38WX9El1eS0avQPZSjTVltxaMqTOqJXV7xuAhajlLr-2BCVyJDxeL0E9el-Q2TG7hDuEj9GcxD5NJUFsAncifRhQKaEnt9bT4gerhJsYynY-zNOR_u6pN3MYNn8XC_hOTIzbeMB_KUcZnYVjkAZLwC7Awpho4MsqJ0iJSotHTMcoYITGsUt6DCzaZBsN4o6y3pHjwDK5SU.qGiNPBgkETM3p4UZ_75YO6XPQ2lKDK7J5Ir4AaK2vcY&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+encyclopedia+of+illnesses+and+disease&qid=1743174406&s=books&sprefix=the+encuclopedia+of+illnesses+and+disease%2Cstripbooks%2C122&sr=1-1), which offers spiritual insight into the pyschosomatic roots of physical symptoms.

And finally, Paul Chek's [How to Eat, Move, and Be Healthy!](https://www.amazon.com/How-Eat-Move-Be-Healthy/dp/158387013X?crid=3P6DGPZBSDIUJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.CCVQuVlg4-dNZx732KBRplGqcnzzfTZ30zqzHTy4YOcSGi_Or2WAgmGtjkTtBblPOI47KfeivicsHf2jPkYHS8MS3YfC6JUhRlWY6VLdX1vpxqcsGkVNcZTJWawH33d_jAdkg5MQ987ifRxA_WglWA.ZvSrpHXQvCLZG94nEJTA2TSw92NOqtqPqVZet2qjd_I&dib_tag=se&keywords=how+to+eat+move+and+be+healthy+paul+chek&qid=1743176497&sprefix=how+to+eat+move+%2Caps%2C152&sr=8-1) lays out the Four Doctor Approach‚ÄîDr. Happy, Dr. Quiet, Dr. Movement, and Dr. Diet‚Äîproviding essential tools for maintaining holistic health in the face of ancestral and embodied trauma.
