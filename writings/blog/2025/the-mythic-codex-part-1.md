#### <i>Soul as The Personal Mythic Codex: Preface</i>

Today I wanted to share a snippet from a book I‚Äôm currently writing.

In this nine-part blogpost series we will explore the Introduction to the concept of ‚ÄúSoul as The Personal Mythic Codex.‚Äù

#### <i>Soul as The Personal Mythic Codex: An Introduction</i>
What is Soul? I could show you 1000 fingers pointing to same Moon, and yet we all get a different perspective on what the Moon is as we all look upon it with our unique set of eyes and perspectives. So it has dawned on me to share my perspective on what I feel what the Moon, or in this case, what the Soul is.

We choose these bodies and the parents we are born to. Our parents did not choose to have us‚Äìwhat I mean to say here is: our parents did not choose the Soul that would incarnate as a human being in the baby‚Äôs body that they chose to have at a given point in time. We chose the baby human-avatar-body born to our parents as a vehicle with which our Soul would embody.

So then what the heck is a Soul? My understanding is this: 
> A Soul is a Unique Personal Mythic Codex comprised of Nine Layers of Unique Identification. Yes, your Soul does include aspects of your astral and cultural identities, but these are only scratching the surface of what the Full and Integrated Identification of what Your Soul truly is.

Let‚Äôs break it down. From the lowest level of identification to the highest level of identification‚Äìwe see this complex web of Identities that the Personal Mythic Codex is comprised of:
- Ancestral
- Cultural
- Religious
- Royal
- Sanctified
- Angelic & Demonic
- Astral / Spiritual
- Mythic
- Cosmic / Proto-Mythic

Through this nine-part blogpost series, we will explore each layer of the Soul‚Äôs Personal Identification starting with the Ancestral Identification, and move up to the next layer of identification with each subsequent blogpost of the series.

Soul as The Personal Mythic Codex: Ancestral Identification
The Ancestral identification truly makes up your root system. This completely relates to your physical body in its present-day incarnate form. Not only can this be tied to lineages from both your Mother‚Äôs and Father‚Äôs bloodlines, but this can also be tied to your immediate (AKA nuclear) and extended families. Often trauma is passed down through the ancestral lineage, and what‚Äôs not healed, must be healed by the next in line. 

See Mark Wolynn‚Äôs book on It Didn‚Äôt Begin With You: How Inherited Family Trauma Shapes Who We Are and How to End the Cycle (link: https://www.amazon.com/Didnt-Start-You-Inherited-Family/dp/1101980389). 

And also, please see Dolores Canon‚Äôs (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_Cannon) collection of books sharing profound wisdom (see: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=dolores+cannon&crid=3LJ6SPIVFT4WO&sprefix=dolores+cannon%2Caps%2C163) and specifically her Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique, a high-level past-life hypnotherapeutic healing technique used to help heal past-life / ancestrally-related trauma. (Subscript 1: https://www.hypnotherapy-directory.org.uk/articles/qhht-the-gold-standard-of-past-life-regression) (Subscript 2: https://journeystoheal.com/services/qhht-los-angeles/)

In addition to this, we can really feel into the trauma that may have been carried over from previous generations into our own bodies today. Yoga is a great practice to explore the unique sensations your body signals to you. And for particularly challenging pains and sensations of your body (ex. for me, I‚Äôve routinely struggled with an EXTREMELY tight left hip all of my life), it‚Äôs good to explore why the intensities of such sensations and pain you may be experiencing in one or more areas of your body to better understand your self, and perhaps to better understand your ancestral line. 

A great book written by Jacques Martel that offers a profound spiritual understanding of the psychosomatic symptoms of the physical body is called The Encyclopedia of Ailments and Diseases: How to Heal the Conflicted Feelings, Emotions, and Thoughts at the Root of Illness (link: https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Ailments-Diseases-Conflicted-Feelings/dp/1644111896?crid=27GL1B6B0EP18&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.lmqlUqe7uyZviFA34X67uF14kNGimJTDS38WX9El1eS0avQPZSjTVltxaMqTOqJXV7xuAhajlLr-2BCVyJDxeL0E9el-Q2TG7hDuEj9GcxD5NJUFsAncifRhQKaEnt9bT4gerhJsYynY-zNOR_u6pN3MYNn8XC_hOTIzbeMB_KUcZnYVjkAZLwC7Awpho4MsqJ0iJSotHTMcoYITGsUt6DCzaZBsN4o6y3pHjwDK5SU.qGiNPBgkETM3p4UZ_75YO6XPQ2lKDK7J5Ir4AaK2vcY&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+encyclopedia+of+illnesses+and+disease&qid=1743174406&s=books&sprefix=the+encuclopedia+of+illnesses+and+disease%2Cstripbooks%2C122&sr=1-1).

In the next blogpost in this series, we will explore the succeeding layer of Soul Identification in this nine-fold perspective of Soul as The Personal Mythic Codex: the Soul‚Äôs Cultural Identification.

If this interested you, please follow me on my social media @jakewallace.io (link to IG account) to stay tuned as I work on writing, editing, and refining my thoughts on various mythological matters. This is also a space where I share other aspects of my writings such as: poetry, fictional excerpts and tech tips. In addition to this, on my accounts I also like to share some art that I‚Äôm creating such as video games I‚Äôm developing, sketches I‚Äôve drawn, music I‚Äôve produced, and art I‚Äôve commissioned for some of my game projects.
