<b>[Back to Blogposts](/writings/blog.html)</b>

<i>March 26th, 2025</i>

#### <i>Soul as The Personal Mythic Codex: Preface</i>

Today I wanted to share a snippet from a book I‚Äôm currently writing.

In this nine-part blogpost series we will explore the Introduction to the concept of ‚ÄúSoul as The Personal Mythic Codex.‚Äù

#### <i>Soul as The Personal Mythic Codex: An Introduction</i>
What is <i>Soul</i>? I could show you 1000 fingers pointing to same Moon, and yet we all get a different perspective on what the Moon is as we all look upon it with our unique set of eyes and perspectives. So it has dawned on me to share my perspective on what I feel what the Moon, or in this case, what the Soul is.

We choose these bodies and the parents we are born to. Our parents did not choose to have us‚Äìwhat I mean to say here is: our parents did not choose the Soul that would incarnate as a human being in the baby‚Äôs body that they chose to have at a given point in time. We chose the baby human-avatar-body born to our parents as a vehicle with which our Soul would embody.

So then what the heck is a Soul? My understanding is this: 
> A Soul is a Unique Personal Mythic Codex comprised of Nine Layers of Unique Identification. Yes, your Soul does include aspects of your astral and cultural identities, but these are only scratching the surface of what the Full and Integrated Identification of what Your Soul truly is.

Let‚Äôs break it down. From the lowest level of identification to the highest level of identification‚Äìwe see this complex web of Identities that the Personal Mythic Codex is comprised of:
- Ancestral
- Cultural
- Religious
- Royal
- Sanctified
- Angelic & Demonic
- Astral / Spiritual
- Mythic
- Cosmic / Proto-Mythic

Through this nine-part blogpost series, we will explore each layer of the Soul‚Äôs Personal Identification starting with the <i>Ancestral Identification</i>, and move up to the next layer of identification with each subsequent blogpost of the series.

#### <i>Soul as The Personal Mythic Codex: Ancestral Identification</i>

The <i>Ancestral identification</i> truly makes up your <b>root system</b>. This completely relates to your <i>physical body</i> in its <i>present-day incarnate form</i>. Not only can this be tied to lineages from both your Mother‚Äôs and Father‚Äôs bloodlines, but this can also be tied to your immediate (AKA nuclear) and extended families. Often trauma is passed down <i>through the ancestral lineages</i>, and what‚Äôs not healed, <b>must</b> be healed by the next in line. 

For more information on how trauma is inherited through ancestral lineages, please see Mark Wolynn‚Äôs book on [It Didn‚Äôt Begin With You: How Inherited Family Trauma Shapes Who We Are and How to End the Cycle](https://www.amazon.com/Didnt-Start-You-Inherited-Family/dp/1101980389). 

And also, as some additional high-level information on healing past-lives related to the ancestral line, please see [Dolores Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_Cannon)'s [collection of books sharing profound wisdom](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=dolores+cannon&crid=3LJ6SPIVFT4WO&sprefix=dolores+cannon%2Caps%2C163) and specifically her <i>Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique</i>, a high-level past-life hypnotherapeutic healing technique used to help heal past-life and ancestrally-related trauma. (Subscript 1: https://www.hypnotherapy-directory.org.uk/articles/qhht-the-gold-standard-of-past-life-regression) (Subscript 2: https://journeystoheal.com/services/qhht-los-angeles/)

In addition to this, we can really <i>feel into the trauma</i> that may have been carried over from previous generations into our own bodies today. <i>Yoga</i> is a great practice to explore the unique sensations your body signals to you on a day-to-day and moment-to-moment bases. For the particularly challenging pains and sensations you feel in your body (ex. for me, I‚Äôve routinely struggled with an <i><b>extremely</b></i> tight left hip all of my life), it‚Äôs good to explore why the intensities of such sensations and pain you may be experiencing in one or more areas of your body to better understand your self, and perhaps to better understand your ancestral line. 

An amazing book written by Jacques Martel that offers <i>profound spiritual understanding of the psychosomatic symptoms of the physical body</i> is called [The Encyclopedia of Ailments and Diseases: How to Heal the Conflicted Feelings, Emotions, and Thoughts at the Root of Illness](https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Ailments-Diseases-Conflicted-Feelings/dp/1644111896?crid=27GL1B6B0EP18&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.lmqlUqe7uyZviFA34X67uF14kNGimJTDS38WX9El1eS0avQPZSjTVltxaMqTOqJXV7xuAhajlLr-2BCVyJDxeL0E9el-Q2TG7hDuEj9GcxD5NJUFsAncifRhQKaEnt9bT4gerhJsYynY-zNOR_u6pN3MYNn8XC_hOTIzbeMB_KUcZnYVjkAZLwC7Awpho4MsqJ0iJSotHTMcoYITGsUt6DCzaZBsN4o6y3pHjwDK5SU.qGiNPBgkETM3p4UZ_75YO6XPQ2lKDK7J5Ir4AaK2vcY&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+encyclopedia+of+illnesses+and+disease&qid=1743174406&s=books&sprefix=the+encuclopedia+of+illnesses+and+disease%2Cstripbooks%2C122&sr=1-1).

And one more book I feel I should mention called [How to Eat, Move, and Be Healthy!](https://www.amazon.com/How-Eat-Move-Be-Healthy/dp/158387013X?crid=3P6DGPZBSDIUJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.CCVQuVlg4-dNZx732KBRplGqcnzzfTZ30zqzHTy4YOcSGi_Or2WAgmGtjkTtBblPOI47KfeivicsHf2jPkYHS8MS3YfC6JUhRlWY6VLdX1vpxqcsGkVNcZTJWawH33d_jAdkg5MQ987ifRxA_WglWA.ZvSrpHXQvCLZG94nEJTA2TSw92NOqtqPqVZet2qjd_I&dib_tag=se&keywords=how+to+eat+move+and+be+healthy+paul+chek&qid=1743176497&sprefix=how+to+eat+move+%2Caps%2C152&sr=8-1), written by Paul Chek that covers <i>the fundamentals of holistic health</i> as laid out by his <i>Four Doctor Approach to Holistic Health‚ÄìDr. Happy, Dr. Quiet, Dr. Movement, and Dr. Diet</i>‚Äìan essential understanding for physical wellness despite all the traumas and pains we may be facing in this lifetime.
