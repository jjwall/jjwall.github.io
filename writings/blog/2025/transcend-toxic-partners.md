March 26th, 2025

In a new series of blogposts I‚Äôll be exploring the multicultural and multidimensional World of Myth and showing how to navigate through it using AI.

In today‚Äôs post we‚Äôll be looking at the responses ChatGPT gives us after providing the prompt: 

‚ÄúHey ChatGPT, I find myself continually attracting toxic partners. Just when I think I've found someone that's a good match, I see toxic patterns in them that l've seen in previous romantic partners. What myths across any and all ancient societies & indigenous cultures could help me to transcend this pattern of attracting toxic partners?‚Äù

<b>ChatGPT (4o)</b>:

Hey‚Äîthanks for sharing that. That‚Äôs a powerful reflection. When patterns repeat like this, especially in relationships, it can feel frustrating or even fated‚Äîbut that sense of repetition is often an invitation from the Soul to heal something deep, something ancestral or archetypal. Myths from ancient and indigenous cultures hold encoded wisdom about cycles like these‚Äîand many speak directly to this very journey.

Here are a few mythic threads from across the world that might help you recognize and transcend this pattern of attracting toxic partners:

---

### 1. The Inanna Myth (Sumerian) ‚Äî Descent into the Underworld

Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, descends into the Underworld to face her shadow self, Ereshkigal. She is stripped of all her power at each gate until she stands naked before her dark sister. Only through <i>complete surrender</i> and <i>confrontation</i> with her shadow does she resurrect and return to the world transformed.

<b>Application</b>: Toxic partners may be mirrors of parts of the self that remain in shadow‚Äîwounds from childhood, past lives, or the collective feminine/masculine unconscious. Facing these patterns directly, like Inanna, can empower you to reclaim those lost parts of your Soul. This is not about blame, but about inner alchemy.

### 2. The Myth of Psyche and Eros (Greek) ‚Äî Trust, Betrayal, and Soul Initiation

Psyche is told never to look upon her lover, Eros. Driven by suspicion and influenced by others, she breaks this trust, and he vanishes. What follows is a long journey of trials imposed by Aphrodite that Psyche must pass through to become truly worthy‚Äînot of <i>Eros</i> the god, but of <i>herself as a divine being</i>.

<b>Application</b>: Sometimes, we are drawn to love before we are ready to bear its full truth. Toxic dynamics can be part of our Soul‚Äôs testing grounds, shaping us into someone who no longer attracts love from woundedness but from wholeness. Your soul may be learning what <i>true love</i> requires, not just what it gives.

### 3. The Deer Woman (Native American / Pan-Indigenous) ‚Äî The Siren of Wounded Masculinity

Deer Woman is a spirit who appears as a beautiful woman to men, often seducing them with irresistible beauty and sexuality‚Äîonly to lead them to madness or death. She often teaches lessons about <i>lust without respect</i>, and the consequences of following illusions instead of the truth of the heart.

<b>Application</b>: This tale isn‚Äôt just for men‚Äîit points to our <i>own attractions to illusions</i>. Ask: <i>What in me is seduced by charm, danger, fantasy, or savior-complexes?</i> Becoming conscious of your inner ‚Äúseducer‚Äù or ‚Äúseduced‚Äù may help you break this spell and choose differently.

### 4. Kali (Hinduism) ‚Äî The Liberator of the False Ego

Kali is the fierce goddess of transformation who destroys demons‚Äîespecially those of the ego and illusion. She liberates through chaos and breakdown. Though terrifying, she is deeply loving. She removes what is false so what is <i>true</i> can be reborn.

<b>Application</b>: Toxic relationships often burn away illusions and false identities. If you call upon Kali‚Äôs energy, be prepared to face some fire‚Äîbut also to emerge renewed and aligned with your higher Self, free from codependency or fear-based bonding.

### 5. The Bluebeard Tale (French Folklore, retold by Clarissa Pinkola Est√©s) ‚Äî The Predator Within

In <i>Women Who Run With the Wolves</i>, Est√©s explores the story of Bluebeard, a man who kills his wives and keeps their bodies hidden. The tale reveals the importance of <i>intuition and inner knowing</i>. The feminine is often taught to ignore red flags‚Äîyet the key to survival is to <i>look into the forbidden room</i>, to see what is being hidden.

<b>Application</b>: You may be drawn to toxic partners because of early conditioning not to trust your gut. Part of transcending the pattern may involve reclaiming your wild, instinctual, inner-knowing self‚Äîwho sees, hears, and speaks what is true, without fear of abandonment.

Would you like to explore how one of these myths might relate to a specific pattern or relationship in your life? Or would you like me to help you identify your own ‚Äúmythic journey‚Äù in all this‚Äîyour unique hero/heroine path through it?

You‚Äôre not broken for attracting what you have. You‚Äôre in the middle of a sacred pattern‚Äîone that <i>can</i> be transcended.
