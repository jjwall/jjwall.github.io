> “If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."<br>
~Nikola Tesla

<i><b>Frequency & the Word</b></i>

Frequency is simply a waveform. A sine wave is a frequency. Talented musicians, instrumentalists, and music producers who use DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) to create music often have a deep understanding of how different waveforms produce unique sounds.

But what exactly <i>is</i> frequency, and why does it matter—especially from a Christian perspective?

<i><b>In the Beginning Was the Sound</b></i>

> “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth… And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. Then God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.” <br>
— Genesis 1:1–3 NLT

> “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” <br>
— John 1:1 KJV

It’s clear that in the Christian creation mythos, the origin of the universe begins with a sound—a divine utterance. “Then God said…” evokes frequency, vibration, and the power of spoken Word.

<i><b>OM: The Primordial Sound of the Big Bang</b></i>

In 1965, physicists Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation—a lingering resonance from the early universe, often described as the “afterglow” of the Big Bang.

This ancient sound, according to some mystics, echoes what Hindus call “OM”—the primordial vibration of creation. Paul Chek often expands OM to <i>AUM_</i> highlighting its four aspects:
* <b>A</b> = Birth / Creation
* <b>U</b> = Life / Preservation
* <b>M</b> = Death / Dissolution
* <b>_</b> = Silence / Infinite Potential

Astronomer Mark Whittle translated oscillations in the CMB into audible sound, revealing a roaring, rising, then fading scream. This is the sound of the beginning—the echo of Genesis.

<i><b>The Infinite Energy of Empty Space</b></i>

Before time began, the vacuum of space wasn’t truly “nothing.” Subatomic particles were constantly popping in and out of existence.

> “There are virtual particles that are constantly coming into existence and vanishing, even in a vacuum.” <br>
~Richard Feynman

> “One teacup of empty space contains enough energy to boil all the world’s oceans.” <br>
~Richard Feynman

This is the mystery of quantum mechanics. The Big Bang was the improbable collision of such particles—a cosmic moment of <i>Let there be light</i>.

<b>The Sin(e) Wave of Consciousness</b>

Let’s visualize the primordial sound of the Big Bang as a <b>sine wave</b>—a beautiful waveform that ascends, descends, and passes through a still center. (And yes, we’re playing with the pun: <i>sin</i> wave.)

This waveform has been vibrating since the dawn of time—and still is.

Much like this oscillation, <b>consciousness</b> fluctuates. We have high points and low points. Joy and grief. Light and dark.

> “And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.” <br>
— John 1:5 KJV

> “And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.” <br>
— Genesis 1:3-4 KJV

To understand light, we must confront darkness. To understand God, we must experience the full range of the human wave.

<i><b>Jesus, the Integrated One</b></i>

> “If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?” <br>
— Matthew 10:25 KJV

The Pharisees (aka the Jewish religious elite) saw Jesus’ <i>shadow</i>—but didn’t realize He had integrated it. Jesus was both Lamb and Lion. Both Light and Dark. The complete Tao in one being.

> “Then one of the elders said to me, “Stop weeping. Look! The mighty Lion of Judah’s tribe, the root of David—he has conquered!" Then I saw a young Lamb standing before the throne... he appeared to have been slaughtered but was now alive!” <br>
— Revelation 5:5-6 TPT

This idea of “integrating the shadow” is central to Jungian psychology. As Robert A. Johnson teaches in <i>Owning Your Own Shadow</i>, we must embrace the full wave—our darkness included.

<i><b>Numerology, 666, and the Descent of Consciousness</b></i>

> “Let the one with understanding solve the meaning of the number of the beast… It is the number of a man. His number is 666.” <br>
— Revelation 13:16–18, NLT

Using numerology:
* 6 + 6 + 6 = 18
* 1 + 8 = 9

In <i>Pythagorean numerology</i>, the number 9 symbolizes <i>human consciousness</i>. But in the form of 666, it represents consciousness in its <b>descending</b> form—fallen, incarnated, “the number of man.”

> <b>Note</b>: A quick explanation for why 666 is an <b>impure</b> representation of the number 9 is because it takes two numerological operations to reduce 666 to 9, i.e. 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9. 

Earth is a school for souls. To enter, you must descend. You must “pay to play.” Just like Adam and Eve. This isn’t a curse—it’s a contract.

<i><b>144,000 and the Ascension of Consciousness</b></i>

> “Then I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him were 144,000…” <br>
— Revelation 14:1–5, NLT

Once again, through numerology:
* 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9

This time, the 9 represents consciousness in its <b>ascending</b> form. The Lamb becomes the Lion. Jesus becomes the King.

The 144,000 are those whose consciousness is purified, or, redeemed—those who learn the “new song.”

> <b>Note</b>: And although the number 144,000 is a more "pure" representation of the number 9 than the number 666 (since it only takes one numerological operation to get to 9, i.e. 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9), 9 by itself is obviously the most pure form of 9. Therefore, 9 by itself should be the intention. See the Buddha's "Middle Path" below.

<i><b>The Threefold Path of the Sine Wave</b></i>

> “If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6, and 9, then you would have the key to the universe."<br>
~Nikola Tesla

> <b>Fig 2</b>. The same graph of our sine wave with the below legend's emojis applied.

Let’s return to our wave and apply this legend:
* 💥 The Big Bang represented by the Theta Point "θ" = Consciousness' Starting Point
* 🐑 The Lamb, represented by the number "666" = Consciousness' Descending Form / The Left-Hand Path
* 🦁 The Lion, represented by the number "144,000" = Consciousness' Ascending Form / The Right-Hand Path
* 🪷 The Lotus, represented by the number "9" = Consciousness' Stable Form as it is Ascending / The Middle Path / The Way of Buddha
* 🧘 The Buddha, represented by the number "9" = Conscousness' Stable Form as it is descending / The Middle Path / The Way of Buddha
* 🕰️ Present day (opposite Big Bang)

My suggestion: <b>Stay on the Middle Path</b> as:
* Too much 666, and you descend into chaos (aka Earth's core / hell / magnetism).
* Too much 144,000, and you become ungrounded—disconnected from Earth (aka outer space / heaven / electricity).
* But the lotus? The middle way? Where the number 9 which represents human consciousness is in its most stable form? That’s where the divine, or the cosmic forces, flows in harmony where the human being floats gently here on the surface of Planet Earth.

So, to sum up, be like Buddha. Be like Feynman. Curious. Open. Light-hearted. Rooted in kindness.
