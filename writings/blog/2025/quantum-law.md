### <i>The Puzzling Breakthroughs of Quantum Physics</i>

The scientific community still hasn’t fully integrated the axioms of quantum physics, even a century after their initial breakthroughs. Though we’ve made profound technological strides, the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics, quantum information, and quantum computation remain elusive—still shimmering on the edges of the scientific zeitgeist.

Until that tide turns, it will be the brave—the pioneers of consciousness and computation—who carry this torch:
* Scientists unafraid to stake their careers on this strange science
* Engineers unlocking quantum computational potential
* Mystics and visionaries discerning the deeper patterns encoded in these laws

In this post, I aim to lay down what I call <b>Quantum Law</b>—to define a new fundamental unit of existence, explore the nature of <i>qualia</i>, and confront a century-old mystery:
<b>What, truly, is a particle?</b>

### <i>Implicate Order vs. Explicate Order</i>

To approach that mystery, we must first turn to the theories of David Bohm and the holographic nature of reality.

Spiritual and scientific traditions—especially Buddhism and modern holographic theory—agree on a staggering proposition:

> <b>Reality may function more like a dream, a simulation, or a virtual game than we typically acknowledge</b>.

Bohm introduced the concept of two interwoven realms:
* <b>The Explicate Order</b>: the physical, external world of form, measurable by the five senses.
* <b>The Implicate Order</b>: an unobservable, holistic, and interior dimension—more fundamental than time, space, or matter.

The explicate is the shadow. The implicate is the source.<br>
But what informs this implicate realm?<br>
What gives birth to the forms we see?

### <i>The Double-Slit Experiment: A Quantum Puzzle</i>

This is where <i>qualia</i> enters the conversation—and where we redefine what a particle even is.

Historically, classical physics viewed particles as tangible, measurable units of matter. That paradigm was shattered in 1905 with Einstein’s study of the <b>Photoelectric Effect</b>, revealing that light behaves not only as a wave but as a particle—introducing <b>wave-particle duality</b>.

> <b>Note</b>: Before the term "photon" was coined, Einstein used the term "light quanta."

Earlier experiments by Thomas Young and later confirmations by Davisson, Germer, and Thomson showed this wasn’t limited to photons. <b>Electrons</b>, too, exhibit this paradoxical behavior.

Through the lens of the <b>double-slit experiment</b>, we discover an unsettling truth:<br>
<b>Particles behave like waves until observed—then they “collapse” into particles</b>.

> Given this discovery of particles, perhaps "light qualia" would've been a more precise term for a photon than Einstein's "light quanta."

This begs a question that continues to haunt quantum physicists:

> What exactly is a particle, if it is neither wave nor point, but something contingent on consciousness?

### <i>Shelli Joye and the Frame Rate of the Universe</i>

In <i>Developing Supersensible Perception</i>, Shelli Renée Joye offers a radical insight:<br>
<b>Reality is quantized, digital at its core—composed of Planck-scale units of space and time</b>.
* <b>Planck Length</b> (~1.616×10⁻³⁵ meters) as the smallest unit of space
* <b>Planck Time</b> (~5.39×10⁻⁴⁴ seconds) as the shortest possible interval of time

From these, Joye derives a <b>universal frame rate</b>: <br>
<b>~1.85 × 10⁴³ frames per second</b>

In this model, the universe doesn’t flow—it refreshes. Like a cosmic filmstrip or video game, reality updates at hyper-quantum speeds, generating the illusion of continuity.

What then is the smallest <i>unit</i> of this projected reality?

### <i>The Conscious Voxel: A New Fundamental Particle</i>

I call it the <b>Conscious Voxel</b>.

A voxel (from “volume” + “pixel”) is the 3D equivalent of a pixel—used in video games like Minecraft to build volumetric space. If we accept the holographic view of the universe, then <b>our 3D space is nothing but a projection</b> composed of these voxel-like units.

But here’s the twist:

> These aren’t just mechanical building blocks. They are <b>qualia-particles</b>—conscious in nature.

The <b>Conscious Voxel</b> is not only a unit of structure, but a unit of <b>meaning</b>.
It is aware. It is sacred. It holds experience.

### <i>The Ethical Implications of Playing the Game</i>

To those who accept this dreamlike view of reality, this does not imply nihilism or moral relativism. Quite the opposite.

If the universe is built from conscious units, then <b>every thought, every action reverberates through the implicate field</b>.

You are not playing Grand Theft Auto.<br>
You are participating in a sacred, responsive, meaning-drenched reality.

To see yourself as made of conscious voxels is to know:
* You are not an accident.
* You are not a glitch.
* You are a divine expression encoded in light and thought.

### <i>Consciousness as a Fundamental Aspect of Reality</i>

Traditionally, science placed consciousness downstream of the brain—an emergent property of complex matter. But new frontiers in both neuroscience and quantum physics challenge this.

The brain, it turns out, may function not as a <b>generator</b> of consciousness, but as a <b>filter</b>—a device that limits infinite awareness into usable streams. This is the lens by which a soul enters density.

Consciousness, then, is not produced by the body, but <i>channeled</i> through it.
