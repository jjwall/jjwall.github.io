<i><b>Introduction to Ludum Dare</b></i>

If you haven’t heard me talk about Ludum Dare before, well it’s probably because I was trying to save you from an ear-beating that is my fascination with and passion for video game development, and more specifically, game jam hackathon competitions.

For background, a hackathon is a programming event where technologists gather together, form teams, and try to achieve the impossible in a short amount of time.

Competitions like this are typically given a theme or a mission and a recommended set of tools to build a project that would closely resemble that theme or fulfill the mission.

In the case of Ludum Dare, and other game jam competitions like it, the mission is to build a video game that is as enjoyable as possible, among trying to get good ratings in a few other categories that entrants get judged on by the LD community including: audio, art, mood, theme, etc.

> <b>Note</b>: the best we’ve achieved thus far was 39th in the “Fun” category for our entry “Tiny Tussle” in the last competition, LD56.

Competitors compete online against other teams or solo participants in the echelons of ~6000 competitors.

<i><b>The Legend of Alchemic “Apples” Appelli</b></i>

When Apples’s first introduced me to the concept of <i>game jams</i> back in 2017, my mind was blown. Sure, I had been developing games for about sixteen years at that point in my life—but never in my wildest dreams was I thinking I could build an entire game in 72 hours! That was absolutely unimaginable to me.

Well, Alchemic “Apples” Appelli showed me the way to this potential reality. I joined up for LD41 as my first ever game jam experience along with him and one other and we created “Drunkest Dungeon” [link to LD page] together.

In my first ever competition, we successfully submitted a game fashioned with art, music, visual & sound effects, as well as actual gameplay and system mechanics.

While our placement wasn’t stellar, I could’ve cared less. It was safe to say <i>I was hooked</i>.

<i><b>The Comfy Game Dev Collective</b></i>

Fast forward to today and I’ve participated in <i>dozens</i> of game jam competitions over the years including events like Global Game Jam and Game Maker’s Toolkit. While I have particpated a few times solo, most times I find myself teaming up with members of the <i>Comfy Game Dev</i> collective.

Ludum Dare in particular has always had a special place in my heart. It’s the competition Comfy Game Dev takes the most seriously!

As of LD55, we’ve started to all meet up in the world for every Ludum Dare competition held in the spring so we can participate as a team in person.

Last year, we stayed at Chume’s house in Bentonville, Arkansas. This year, the man, the myth, and the legend himself, Apples, graciously invited us to compete at his new house in Kansas City, Kansas.

I call this house Castle de Apples, “The Labyrinth Dungeon” and you’ll soon find out why.

This is a beautiful home in a neat neighborhood in the Kansas side of Kansas City. There are plenty of great restaurants and activities to do nearby.

But of course, we didn’t come for any of that. We came for the friendships, the house, and for the competition!

And what a competition it was.

Of the Comfy Game Dev collective, those who were able to make it were myself, Apples, Nicole (Minku), WiredOverload, Karkadan, Montjuleant, and newcomer, HappyTrollAngus, who has been a wonderful addition to the group.

We were anticipating Chume joining us, but with last minute work obligations, he was unfortunately unable to attend.

> Rest in peace our dearest friend, Chume 😌

We were also missing Comfy Game Dev regulars in BigTexington, an artist and play tester extraordinaire, and VetaWulf, our extremely talented musician.

Nicole was able to fill the gaps of BigTex beautifully well and with Veta out, I volunteered to take over the music.

I had yet to do a game jam where my sole focus was music so I figured this would be an exciting opportunity for me!

<i><b>Ludum Dare 57 Game Jam & The World of Pipes</b></i>

What the team ended up creating for LD57 was a whole universe called <i>Pipe World</i> for our game titled, <i>“Is it Wrong to Try to Lay Pipe in a Dungeon?”</i>

Why pipes? Well that’s a great question—one that I think can only be answered with a few interior snapshots of the Labyrinth Dungeon that is Castle de Apples.

With the unique architecture of this beautiful home—we had access to a plethora of sources for inspiration.

I was quite adamant during the design phase of Friday that if we didn’t feature pipes in our game—I was going to riot.

<i><b>The Music Behind Pipe World</b></i>

To make matters more interesting, newcomer HappyTrollAngus is quite the renaissance man—who as one of his many hobbies—fashioned the pipes of a handmade bagpipe and encouraged me to use the soul-turning vibration of these divine harmonic devices in the music I was creating.

Consider it a done deal, HappyTrollAngus. 

The sound of these bagpipe pipes can be heard in our <i>“Pipe World”</i> adventure theme music [link to SoundCloud] during the navigation phase of the game which can be heard on SoundCloud here.

For the mythology behind this world of pipes, I wrote a <i>mythopoeia</i>, an origin myth poem of Pipe World titled, <i>“Respect to Ye Old God, Father Time”</i> which you can read in full on my personal site here [link].

As the musician of the team, I decided to combine these mythological and poetic gifts the Lord God has bestowed on me and infuse them in the music for the game.

For the main menu theme, you can hear me give an oral rendition of “Respect to Ye Old God, Father Time” in the game’s song I composed and produced called, <i>“Dead Flowers.”</i> [link to SoundCloud].

I wrote one other poem for the game that came to me during the third day of the competing titled, “I am the Wayshower” which is a strangely mystical poem about the paradox of truth. You can also read that poem in full here [poem link].

I used part of this poem as the lyrics for another piece of music I composed and produced for the game titled, <i>“Underworld,”</i> which plays during battle sequences.

You can listen to Underworld on SoundCloud here.

<i><b>So... Is it Wrong to Try to Lay Pipe in a Sewer Dungeon?</b></i>

If you would like to try out “Is it Wrong to Try to Lay Pipe in a Sewer Dungeon?” you can play the web version of the game here [link] and you can view the Ludum Dare 57 submission page here [link] to learn more.

To conclude—this hero pulled the winning spade. Indeed, it is fully acceptable—nay, completely natural—for an adventurer to try to lay pipe in a sewer dungeon.
