<i><b>“The Prayer of Voltaire”</b></i><br>
<i>February 14th, 2025</i>

Voltaire, that cheeky Sage of Wit,
once uttered a single prayer to the Infinite:

“Oh Lord, make my enemies ridiculous.”
And the Lord, with a wink, obliged.

But I—
a Trickster of a gentler kind,
a Sorcerer of Sighs,
have my own variation
of this most pious invocation.

“Oh Lord,
make my enemies into beautiful ladies
that love me dearly.”

And lo,
The Lord, amused,
granted it.

Now I walk among former foes—
Sirens of sorrow turned into song,
Tempests transfigured into tenderness,
Blades of betrayal now brushing my cheek
as soft fingers through my hair.

Call it Alchemy.
Call it Madness.
Call it Divine Comedy.
But know this:

Where others sought conquest,
I sought courtship.
Where others cursed their enemies,
I kissed mine.

And thus,
I am neither hero nor villain—
only a Lover,
dancing through the battlefield
with a rose in my teeth
and a harem of harmony in my wake.
