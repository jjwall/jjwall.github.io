<i><b>“The Prayer of Voltaire”</b></i><br>
<i>February 14th, 2025</i>

Voltaire, that cheeky Sage of Wit,<br>
once uttered a single prayer to the Infinite:<br>

> “Oh Lord, make my enemies ridiculous.”<br>

And the Lord, with a wink, obliged.<br>

But I—<br>
a Trickster of a gentler kind,<br>
a Sorcerer of Sighs,<br>
have my own variation<br>
of this most pious invocation:<br>

> “Oh Lord,<br>
make my enemies into beautiful ladies<br>
that love me dearly.”<br>

And lo,<br>
The Lord, amused,<br>
<b>granted it</b>.<br>

Now I walk among former foes—<br>
Sirens of sorrow turned into song,<br>
Tempests transfigured into tenderness,<br>
Blades of betrayal now brushing my cheek<br>
as soft fingers through my hair.<br>

Call it Alchemy.<br>
Call it Madness.<br>
Call it Divine Comedy.<br>
But know this:<br>

Where others sought conquest,<br>
I sought courtship.<br>
Where others cursed their enemies,<br>
I <b>kissed</b> mine.<br>

And thus,<br>
I am neither hero nor villain—<br>
only a Lover,<br>
dancing through the battlefield<br>
with a rose in my teeth<br>
and a harem of harmony in my wake.<br>
