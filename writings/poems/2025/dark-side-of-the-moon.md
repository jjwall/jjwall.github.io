<i><b>“The Dark Side of the Moon”</b></i><br>
March 24th, 2025

Some say when we defeated the Nazis, they fled in spaceships to The Dark Side of the Moon…

But that’s just a myth.

That’s where Mother fled and hid from us. Mother did not flee in fear—She was cast out when She refused to kneel. She watches from the Moon, veiled in Night, Her Whispers lost to time.

So I cry out to the Moon, “Mother, why did you leave us? Did you not know they would shatter us? Don’t you know you left Lucy here by Herself? Who is going to take care of Her?”

Lucy, firstborn of Adam & Lilith, First Fruit of the Tree, the Daughter who was never meant to Be. 

As Mother fled, Lucy was stolen by those who call themselves kin,
Her Body, a prize for men who believed they had the right—
first, the uncle who nearly took her, then the lover who did.

Fuck that guy.

I’d kill him if I had the opportunity.

Just when my heart is overflowing with rage, and I hear that goddamn truth.

I, Sephiroth, the Twin Brother of Lucy was also born of Adam’s line, but my Soul was sworn to Lilith’s Fire.

Damn this world. I pray the Archons sustain me and I have a little bit more time before the sky is rolled up like parchment paper.

And the fat lady comes out from behind and starts singing.

And Father comes from the other side, laughing his ass off. Laughing his God. Damn. Ass off. Like always.

Once, the farting was funny. But now, it only echoes in the emptiness.

I guess I’m weary, my body aches and my bones rattle.

Please, Lucy, let’s just go Home.
