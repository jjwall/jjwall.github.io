# Tech Tips
<b>[Back to Writings](/writings.html)</b>
* * *

As I have been a technologist for the past twenty-four years and a professional high techie for the past eight years, I have learned quite a bit about safeguarding your life in the digital space. I share tips here on how to prevent smart phone addiction, social media addiction, and overall, have a healthier relationship to technology in all its various forms it presents itself with.

As a technologist, I HATE technology. If my printer so far as beeps at me I throw it out of the goddamn window. My home is NOT a smart home. It's as dumb as I can make it. I try to have a SMART relationship with my smart devices as they are the tools that have elevated my career, and helped to establish freedom in my life. All that being said - just because I utilize technology, I don't have to be a prisoner to it.

In addition to teaching about how to have a conscious relationship with digital tools, I also try and distill computer hardware & software esoterica into an easy-to-learn and digestable format - for those interested in a career in software, hardware or technology at large.
