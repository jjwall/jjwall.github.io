Growing up Christian I naturally gravitated towards studying the Occult as well as Magick. I enjoyed reading Grimoires, Tomes & Codices simply because it was taboo and I wasn’t “supposed” to study them. 

Yet I thought differently. I knew knowledge and information was power - words that I read couldn’t hurt me. These magical threads eventually pulled me to the writings of the Diabolical Dark Magician Aleister Crowley. And as The Great Magical King Solomon was my favorite figure in the Holy Bible, it was an easy purchase when I came across Crowley’s channeled Grimoire, The Three Magical Books of Solomon: The Testament of Solomon & His Greater & Lesser Keys in One Volume.

This book is essentially an Apocryphal Text of how King Solomon summoned Demons to command at his will using his Magical Ring and Personal Sigil, as drawn out on the cover of this Grimoire.

The Lore (that I wholeheartedly believe) is that King Solomon summoned these Pure-Spirited (non-evil) Demons to build the Last Jewish Temple of God before it was destroyed by the Babylonians.

The Magic of Demonology contained in this book is known as the Ars Goetia which contain summoning rituals to summon the 72 Goetic Demons.

As the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) has 72 Holy Pronunciations, it’s my understanding that these 72 Pure-Spirited Demons represent the 72 Physical Manifestations of the 72 Names of God the Creator.

While Aleister Crowley is a terrifying figure and I’d recommend you tread lightly if you feel called to study his works, he has a great quote that has resonated deeply with me:

“Magic is simply the practice of turning your life into a work of art.”

I like to include demon girl characters into my video games inspired by the Ars Goetia as I weave my Proto-Mythic Morningstar background lore into my games’ story-telling components.
