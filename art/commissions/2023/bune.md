# Bune

<i>December 9th, 2023</i>

I like to include demon girl characters into my video games inspired by the <i>Ars Goetia</i> (see my blogpost on [A Perspective on Magick](/writings/blog/2025/a-perspective-on-magick.html) for more info) as I weave my Proto-Mythic Morningstar background lore into my games’ story-telling components.

Montjuleant (<b>montjuleant</b> on Discord) is the artist who helped me channel this Pure-Spirited Beautiful Girl version of the Demon known as Bune:

Her description is the following (modified to reflect The Pure-Spirited Beautiful Girl version of Bune):

> (26.) BUNE, or BIMÉ.--The Twenty-sixth Spirit is Buné (or Bim). She is a Strong, Great and Mighty Duchess. She appeareth in the form of a Dragon with three heads, one like a Dog, one like a Gryphon, and one like a Woman. She speaketh with a high and comely Voice. She changeth the Place of the Dead, and causeth the Spirits which be under her to gather together upon your Sepulchres. She giveth Riches unto a Man, and maketh him Wise and Eloquent. She giveth true Answers unto Demands.
And she governeth 30 Legions of Spirits. Her Seal is this, unto the which she oweth Obedience. She hath another Seal (which is the first of these, but the last is the best)

Her Sigils are these, as mentioned in the above description:
