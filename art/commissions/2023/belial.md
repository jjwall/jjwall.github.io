<i>December 9th, 2023</i>

I like to include demon girl characters into my video games inspired by the <i>Ars Goetia</i> (see my blogpost on [A Perspective on Magick](/writings/blog/2025/a-perspective-on-magick.html) for more info) as I weave my Proto-Mythic Morningstar background lore into my gamesâ€™ story-telling components.

Montjuleant (<b>montjuleant</b> on Discord) is the artist who helped me channel this Pure-Spirited Beautiful Girl version of the Demon known as Belial, or Bell for short:

Her description is the following (modified to reflect The Pure-Spirited Beautiful Girl version of Belial):

> (68.) BELIAL.--The Sixty-eighth Spirit is Belial. She is a Mighty and a Powerful Queen, and was created next after LUCIFER. She appeareth in the Form of Two Beautiful Angels sitting in a Chariot of Fire. She speaketh with a Comely Voice, and declareth that she fell first from among the worthier sort, that were before Michael, and other Heavenly Angels. Her Office is to distribute Presentations and Senatorships, etc.; and to cause favour of Friends and of Foes. She giveth excellent Familiars, and governeth 50 Legions of Spirits. Note well that this Queen Belial must have Offerings, Sacrifices and Gifts presented unto her by the Exorcist, or else she will not give True Answers unto his Demands. But then she tarrieth not one hour in the Truth, unless she be constrained by Divine Power. And her Seal is this, which is to be worn as aforesaid, etc.

Her Sigil is this, as mentioned in the above description:
