<i>December 10th, 2024</i>

This is a character I created known as "Celeste" for a yet-to-be-announced rail-shooter mobile game I have been designing which exists in a Sci-Fi world based on my [Morningstar Mythos](https://morninstarmythos.github.io/).

Montjuleant (<b>montjuleant</b> on Discord) is the artist who I commissioned for this portrait of Celeste:

Celeste is the main protagonist of the video game mentioned above. She is a high ranking member of the Galactic Federations's Fallen Angel Task Force which enlists her on Planetary Missions requiring her to travel via her Mecha Spaceship equipped with Faster-Than-Light travel technology.

Her missions require her to bounce around the various Solar Systems within the Milky Way Galaxy FTL hopping to biological life-supporting planets where her Mecha Spaceship transforms into a Planet Core Driller Mech inserting her into Deep Planet locations where she can access the physical manifestation of the planet's underworld.

Each underworld she visits is unique and, as such, Celeste must learn how to navigate the various underworld terrains she encounters. Her mission goals are to remove the Corrupted Crystal Lattice structures at the core of each planet. If successful, the planet's population of humonoid life forms will have an easier time accessing Ascension Technologies allowing them to apply for "Galactic Federation Citizenship." Which, of course, has the best healthcare plan in the entire galaxy.

During her mission deployments, Celeste encounters the Evil One and His Armies of "Corrupting Creation Forces." As such, the game's primary antagonist and reoccuring boss that often challenges Celeste on just about every Planetary Mission Deployment is [Queen Lilith, Mother of All the Fallen](/art/commissions/2024/lilith.html).
