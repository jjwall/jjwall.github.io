# Celeste
<b>[Back to Commissioned Art](/art/commissions.html)</b>

<i>March 21st, 2024</i>

This is a character I designed known as "Celeste" for a yet-to-be-announced rail-shooter mobile game I have been designing which exists in a Sci-Fi world based on my Morningstar Mythos.

Montjuleant (<b>montjuleant</b> on Discord) is the artist who I commissioned for this portrait of Celeste:

    />
