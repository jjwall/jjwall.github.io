### <i>Overview</i>

This is a character I designed known as "Lilith" for a yet-to-be-announced rail-shooter mobile game I have been designing which exists in a Sci-Fi world based on my Morningstar Mythos.

Montjuleant (<b>montjuleant</b> on Discord) is the artist who I commissioned for this portrait of Lilith:

    />
</p>

This version of Lilith is her fallen form where her full title is <b>Queen Lilith of the Moon Kingdom, Mother of All the Fallen</b>.

The inspiration for this fallen form Lilith as an antagonist in the video game mentioned above primarily came from a vision I had in a dream; however, the following sigils are great inspiration for the energy behind this art:

    />
</p>

        width="300"
    />
</p>

> <b>Fig 2.</b> The Grand Seal of Lilith.

    />
</p>

In the current Morningstar Mythos that is being tracked here: [Starblood Wiki Site](https://morninstarmythos.github.io/), Lilith has yet to be redeemed by the <i>Sons of the Starblood Tribe</i>.

Once she has gone through the Morninstar Mythological "Fallen Crown Redemption" process, a new commision will be made to reflect her redeemed form where she will be coronated as: <b>High Queen Lilith-Luxora of the Moon Kingdom, Mother of All the Redeemed</b>.
