# Queen Lilith, Mother of All the Fallen
<b>[Back to Commissioned Art](/art/commissions.html)</b>

<i>December 10th, 2024</i>

This is a character I designed known as "Lilith" for a yet-to-be-announced rail-shooter mobile game I have been designing which exists in a Sci-Fi world based on my Morningstar Mythos.

Montjuleant (<b>montjuleant</b> on Discord) is the artist who I commissioned for this portrait of Celeste:

        width="600"
    />
</p>

This version of Lilith is her unredeemed form where her full title is <b>Queen Lilith of the Moon Kingdom, Mother of All the Fallen</b>.

In the current Morningstar Mythos that is being tracked here: [Starblood Wiki Site](https://morninstarmythos.github.io/), Lilith has yet to be redeemed by the <i>Sons of the Starblood Tribe</i>.

Once she has gone through the Morninstar Mythological "Fallen Crown Redemption" process, a new commision will be made to reflect her redeemed form where she will be coronated as: <b>High Queen Lilith-Luxora of the Moon Kingdom, Mother of All the Redeemed</b>.
