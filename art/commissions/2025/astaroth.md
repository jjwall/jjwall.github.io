# Astaroth
<b>[Back to Commissioned Art](/art/commissions.html)</b>
* * *

<i>May 8th, 2025</i>

I like to include demon girl characters into my video games inspired by the <i>Ars Goetia</i> (see my blogpost on [A Perspective on Magick](/writings/blog/2025/a-perspective-on-magick.html) for more info) as I weave my Proto-Mythic Morningstar background lore into my games’ story-telling components.

This Pure-Spirted (non-evil) Beautiful Girl version of Astaroth is currently being commissioned. Her influences are as follows:

In the current Morningstar Mythos that is being tracked here: [Starblood Wiki Site](https://morninstarmythos.github.io/), Astaroth has yet to be redeemed by the <i>Sons of the Starblood Tribe</i>.

Once she has gone through the Morninstar Mythological "Fallen Angel Redemption" process, a new commision will be made to reflect her redeemed form where she will be coronated as: <b>High Queen Inanna Ishtar of the Underworld, Wife of High King Ba’al Zabul</b>.
