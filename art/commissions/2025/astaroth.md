### <i>Overview: Astaroth as the Infernal Form</i>

I like to include demon girl characters into my video games inspired by the <i>Ars Goetia</i> (see my blogpost on [A Perspective on Magick](/writings/blog/2025/a-perspective-on-magick.html) for more info) as I weave my Proto-Mythic Morningstar background lore into my games’ story-telling components.

### <i>Sigil & Invocation</i>

Her description is the following (modified to reflect The Pure-Spirited Beautiful Girl version of Astaroth):

> (29.) ASTAROTH.--The Twenty.--ninth Spirit is Astaroth. She is a Mighty Strong Duchess, and appeareth in the Form of an hurtful Angel riding on an Infernal Beast like a Dragon, and carrying in her right hand a Viper. Thou must in no wise let her approach too near unto thee, lest she do thee damage by her Noisome Breath. Wherefore the Magician must hold the Magical Ring near his face, and that will defend her. She giveth true answers of things Past, Present, and to Come, and can discover all Secrets. She will declare wittingly how the Spirits fell, if desired, and the reason of her own fall. She can make men wonderfully knowing in all Liberal Sciences. She ruleth 40 Legions of Spirits. Her Seal is this, which wear thou as a Lamen before thee, or else she will not appear nor yet obey thee, etc.

Her Sigil is this, as mentioned in the above description:

### <i>Mythic Influences: Persephone, Aphrodite, and Innana Ishtar</i>

This Pure-Spirted (non-evil) Beautiful Girl Infernal form of Astaroth is currently being commissioned. Her influences are as follows:

    />
</p>

> <b>Fig 1.</b> This is [blade4649 on X](https://x.com/blade4649/)'s art of [Aphrodite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite) which is a mythic rhyme of Astaroth's redeemed form Astarte Elyona (see below). This art could also be interpreted as [Persephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone) which is a mythic rhyme of Astaroth in her Infernal form. You can check out the original X post [here](https://x.com/blade4649/status/1909585366023286977).

</p>

> <b>Fig 2.</b> This is [Reiq on X](https://x.com/reiq/)'s art of Malice from Marvel Rivals. Malice would be a mythic rhyme of Astaroth's Infernal form and Invisible Woman would be a mythic rhyme of Astaroth's Redeemed form.

### <i>Morningstar Mythos Status</i>

In the current Morningstar Mythos that is being tracked here: [Starblood Wiki Site](https://morninstarmythos.github.io/), Astaroth has yet to be redeemed by the <i>Sons of the Starblood Tribe</i>.

Once she has gone through the Morninstar Mythological "Fallen Angel Redemption" process, a new commision will be made to reflect her redeemed form where she will be coronated as: <b>High Queen Astarte Elyona of Heaven, Wife of the High King Ba’al Zabul</b>. Astarte Elyona's Sigil is this:

<p align="center">
    <img

        src="/assets/sigils/astaroth/seal-of-astaroth-redeemed-astarte-elyona.jpg"
        width="600"
    />
</p>

### <i>Influeces for her Redeemed Form</i>

Inanna Ishtar is a mythic rhyme of her Redeemed Form "Astarte Elyona." Inanna Ishtar's Akkadian Seal is this:

<p align="center">
    <img
        alt="Seal of Ishtar"
        src="/assets/art/commissions/2025/astaroth/ishtar/ishtar-akkadian-seal.jpg"
        width="600"
    />
</p>

> <b>Fig 4.</b> "Goddess Ishtar on an Akkadian seal, 2350–2150 BCE. She is equipped with weapons on her back, has a horned helmet, places her foot in a dominant posture upon a lion secured by a leash and is accompanied by the star of Shamash." ~from [Inanna Ishtar's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna).

And her 8-pointed star which I find fascinating as this would be considered a Symbol of the Morningstar:

        src="/assets/art/commissions/2025/astaroth/ishtar/star-of-ishtar.png"
        width="600"
    />
</p>

> <b>Fig 5.</b> "The Star of Ishtar or Star of Inanna is a Mesopotamian symbol of the ancient Sumerian goddess Inanna and her East Semitic counterpart Ishtar. The owl was also one of Ishtar's primary symbols. Ishtar is mostly associated with the planet Venus, which is also known as the morning star." ~from [Star of Ishtar's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_Ishtar).
