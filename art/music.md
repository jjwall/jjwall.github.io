# Music Productions
<b>[Back to Art](/art.html)</b>
* * *

I have been fascinated with music all of my life having taken drumming lessons since the age of nine and picked up piano and music production at the age of fourteen. I'm often inspired by existing tunes that I can't help but desire to cover. 

The following tracks are some SoundCloud tunes I've posted over the years, including both full production covers and originals. Unfortunately, I lost a lot of my music to cyber space when MySpace experienced a loss of their music data.
