The Divine Feminine has always inspired my art. There's nothing I'd rather draw then the Female Body. Kind of like a song you hear and you just HAVE to learn how to play it on your instrument of choice - I'll see art on Twitter X, in a video game, anime, film, TV show, or in an artbook and have to do my own sketch of it. The following are some sketches I've made over the years:
