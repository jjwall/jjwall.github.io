I have been fascinated with music all of my life having taken drumming lessons since the age of 9 and picked up piano and music production at the age of 14. I'm often inspired by existing tunes that I can't help but desire to cover. The following tracks are some SoundCloud tunes I've posted over the years, including both covers and originals. Unfortunately, I lost a lot of my music to cyber space when MySpace experienced a loss of their music data.
