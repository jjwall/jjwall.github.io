* Site: [https://jjwall.github.io/BoardhouseTS/](https://jjwall.github.io/BoardhouseTS/)
* <u>About</u>: This is an onging project written in TypeScript. It is a game engine for browsers. The project goals are to enable users to quickly develop prototypes, which makes it a perfect game engine to use for weekend game dev competitions such as Ludum Dare, Global Game Jam, and Game Makers Tool Kit. The engine features a React-like UI layer, an Entity Component System, State management for handling scenes, and uses Three.js as the rendering layer. Currently I am in the process of using Cordova to enable exporting projects into native iOS and Android code.

* Global Game Jam submission: [https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/occupational-hazards-5](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/occupational-hazards-5)
* Source code: [https://github.com/apples/ggj2020](https://github.com/apples/ggj2020)
* <u>About</u>: This was a game written in my game engine, BoardhouseTS, by three developers (see below) for the 2020 Global Game Jam. I was not part of the team that wrote any of the game code, I only provided the engine code. Very little communication was needed from me for them to consume the APIs exposed by my game engine. The game got 4th place at the Houston, TX branch of GGJ.

* Source code: [https://github.com/jjwall/LD45](https://github.com/jjwall/LD45)
* <u>About</u>: The project was also developed using my game engine, BoardhouseTS, for Ludum Dare 45. I was the sole developer of the game code and also created all the art and sound assets used in the game. My inspiration was to try and create a simpler version of StarCraft. My learning goals were to understand how to currently implement MouseEvents into my engine.

* <u>About</u>: This was the first project where I pulled in additional developers to build a game using my game engine, BoardhouseTS. It was also the first time I got a chance to compete in a Global Game Jam. I worked on the code for the asteroids and creating the visual assets.

* <u>About</u>: This was the first game I developed using my game engine, BoardhouseTS. It used a much older version of my engine that used PixiJS as the rendering layer. PixiJS has since been thrown out in favor of Three.js.
